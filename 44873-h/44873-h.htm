<br />FLAMING ISLAND</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Dave. See those strange clouds?&rdquo;
Florence Huyler shaded her eyes to look
away toward the horizon. Her face wore an
expression of bewildered curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see them. They <i>are</i> queer!&rdquo; young
&ldquo;Captain Davie,&rdquo; as everyone called him, replied
as he wrinkled his brow. After giving
the wheel of his motor-driven craft a turn, he
studied those clouds. &ldquo;Scurrying along the
horizon,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;they roll quite a bit,
don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and such a peculiar shade of yellow,&rdquo;
Florence added. &ldquo;Oh well, clouds are different
up here on Lake Superior.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to worry about, I guess,&rdquo; said
Dave, as once again he gave his attention to
the wheel.</p>
<p>As for Florence, at the moment she had
nothing to do but think. And such bitter-sweet
thoughts as they were! She was cruising
on Lake Superior. That was grand! She
had always loved the water. What was still
more magnificent, she was landing twice a
week on the shores of that place of great enchantment&mdash;Isle
Royale.</p>
<p>Once, you will recall from reading <i>The Phantom
Violin</i>, Florence with two companions had
made her summer home on a huge wrecked
ship off the rocky shores of this very island.
What a summer that had been! Adventure?
Plenty of it. The ship had at last been completely
destroyed during a storm. They had
barely escaped with their lives. The girl shuddered
a little even now at the thought of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Florence was large, strong, fearless. A marvelous
swimmer and a grand athlete, she had
little to fear on land or water. And yet, as her
eyes swept the deck of the <i>Wanderer</i>, the sixty-foot
motor-boat on which she rode, a troubled
look came into her fine blue eyes. Nor were
those low, circling clouds the cause of her
worry. She and her cousin Dave, quite as
courageous and venturesome as she, had embarked
upon an enterprise that promised to be
a failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather will lose his money. He can&rsquo;t
afford to lose, and it&rsquo;s not all our fault,&rdquo; she
told herself a little bitterly. But now her
thoughts were broken by a short, stout,
bronze-faced man, an Indian who appeared
at the cabin door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, John!&rdquo; she pointed, speaking to the
Indian. &ldquo;Look at those strange clouds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Smoke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sm-smoke!&rdquo; the girl stared. Then she
breathed a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Oh, from Canada!
Forest fires. I&rsquo;ve heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Canada. Come from Isle Royale, that
smoke. Island on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On&mdash;on fire?&rdquo; It was Dave who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&mdash;that&rsquo;s the end.&rdquo; His voice was
toneless with discouragement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Isle Royale on fire! Florence tried to think
what that might mean. For weeks there had
been no rain. During their short stops at
Chippewa Harbor, Tobin&rsquo;s and Belle Isle, she
had often walked back into the forests. She
had found the trees, the moss, the soil dry as
tinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what part of the island is on fire?&rdquo;
she managed to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Siskowit Bay.&rdquo; The Indian took the wheel,
relieving Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where all those boys are camped?&rdquo; the
girl asked.</p>
<p>The Indian nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;do you suppose they are in danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; John twisted the wheel, &ldquo;Bad
fire.&rdquo; He scanned the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said Dave, &ldquo;do you know the rocks
of Harlem Reef?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every rock.&rdquo; The Indian showed his fine
teeth in a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think,&rdquo; Dave weighed his words
carefully, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better put in there.
It&rsquo;s off our course, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; a voice broke in sharply,
&ldquo;A fire on Isle Royale?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence did not finish. As she looked into
the eyes of the man who had spoken she read
there something that almost frightened her.</p>
<p>He was a short, stout man, one of the few
passengers on that voyage. In his face she
seemed to detect a look almost of antagonism.
&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; she thought in sudden consternation,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen him before, I am sure
of that. What can we have done to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the man spoke, none of this was to
be detected in his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fire on Isle Royale?&rdquo; He even forced
a smile. &ldquo;Too bad. But I can&rsquo;t say that concerns
us. This is a passenger boat, bound for
Rock Harbor. Lake Siskowit, I&rsquo;m told, is
some twenty miles from there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fire,&rdquo; Captain Davie spoke slowly, &ldquo;any
fire that destroys property concerns all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swing her about, John,&rdquo; he turned to the
Indian. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your schedule calls for first stop at
Rock Harbor,&rdquo; the man insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, but an emergency exists.
We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Emergency my eye!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s dark face
flushed angrily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve contracted to have me
at Rock Harbor by four o&rsquo;clock, the <i>Iroquois</i>
docks an hour later. I shall have just time to
transact my business and catch the <i>Iroquois</i>.
If you don&rsquo;t get me to Rock Harbor on time,
you&rsquo;ll regret it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; was Dave&rsquo;s slow rejoinder.
Turning to the Indian he said quietly, &ldquo;John,
we&rsquo;re putting in at Siskowit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break you!&rdquo; the man exclaimed angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Dave laughed uncertainly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
impossible. We&rsquo;re already broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning on his heel, the passenger strode
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big shot,&rdquo; said Indian John, jerking his
head toward the retreating figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of big shot?&rdquo; Florence asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; John twisted the wheel.
&ldquo;Not Houghton man. Came from somewhere.
Don&rsquo;t know where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dave, &ldquo;big shot or no, we&rsquo;re
off for Siskowit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Leaving the pilot house, Florence walked
to the prow of the boat, then dropped into a
steamer chair. At once her alert mind was
busy on past and present. They were headed
for an island. It was on fire. The island was a
regular tinderbox. There was gasoline on
board. Their boat was motor-driven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred gallons of gas,&rdquo; she
thought with a shudder. &ldquo;To be of any real
help we&rsquo;ll have to draw in close to the island.
That&rsquo;s dangerous&mdash;might be disastrous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, like a weather-vane whipped suddenly
about by the wind, her thoughts turned to the
past. It was to have been a rich and glorious
adventure&mdash;this summer cruise. Four months
before she had been seated with a jolly, friendly
group, her own people for the most part,
listening to a promoter&rsquo;s rosy tale of money
to be made by a boat running from the mainland
to Isle Royale.</p>
<p>And they had the boat! Ah! yes, there had
been their weakness. The <i>Wanderer</i>, her
grandfather&rsquo;s boat, had been tied up at the
dock for two years. Before that it had carried
fruit across Lake Michigan. Trucks had
ruined this trade. Then, too, a weak heart had
forced her grandfather into retirement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you young people!&rdquo; the promoter had
exclaimed, &ldquo;you know how to run the boat,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh sure,&rdquo; Dave had grinned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
on the boat with the captain here for two
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Rufus is a fine engineer,&rdquo; Florence
had exclaimed, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Her heart had
given a great leap at the thought of fresh and
glorious adventure. &ldquo;I&mdash;I know a lot about
the island. I&rsquo;ll be first mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; the promoter had begun
pacing back and forth before the open fire,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll make a fortune! You know the island
is being made into a national park,&rdquo; he had
enthused, &ldquo;Thousands will be wanting to go
there. Most beautiful spot in all the Midwest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the temperature,&rdquo; he had fairly exploded,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never above seventy, even when
all the rest of the country is melting at a hundred
in the shade. Ten dollars round trip.
Fifty to seventy-five passengers to the trip.
Three trips a week. You&rsquo;ll wear diamonds!
You&rsquo;ll go to college! You&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl thought now, sitting there
watching the distant island come nearer, &ldquo;yes,
we took it all in. Half of what he said was
true. It is a glorious island. The temperature
is wonderful, but how many people know it?
Not many. How many are coming? Very
few. We&rsquo;re licked, that&rsquo;s all. Grandfather
spent two thousand dollars he couldn&rsquo;t well
spare to fit out our boat. Here we are making
trip after trip, taking in enough to make
expenses, not earning a cent, and paying back
nothing. Diamonds! College!&rdquo; She laughed
a trifle bitterly.</p>
<p>No time now for regrets, however. The
<i>Wanderer</i> was rapidly nearing shore. She could
catch the red glow of the fire. Would there
be real danger? There were ten passengers
on board. Was it right to endanger the lives
of these, even to the slightest degree? Dropping
back to the side of her stalwart cousin,
she confided to him her fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;There may
be some small boat that can take the passengers
on to Chippewa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; the girl agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>As the <i>Wanderer</i> at last rounded the point
of land hiding the camp on Siskowit Bay, it
took no second look to tell them that the situation
was critical. Creeping slowly forward
from bush to bush and tree to tree, the fire
was moving like some slow, red serpent toward
the stout camp that had been built by
so much labor and such willing hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re nice boys,&rdquo; Florence breathed,
thinking of the C.C.C. boys who had built the
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine chaps,&rdquo; her cousin agreed.</p>
<p>Once before the <i>Wanderer</i> had put into this
harbor with supplies and, becoming storm-bound,
its crew had spent several happy hours
with the campers. Having seen neither mothers
nor sisters for months, the fellows had
treated Florence as if she were a queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be broke,&rdquo; Dave muttered grimly,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;re not too broke to offer a helping
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going in there?&rdquo; demanded an
angry voice. Once more it was the &ldquo;big shot,&rdquo;
as Indian John had called him, who spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>For a short space of time no one replied.
In that brief moment, the number of questions
that passed through Florence&rsquo;s mind was astonishing.
Who was this man? What did he
really want?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; it was Dave who spoke at last,
quietly as ever, &ldquo;yes, we are going in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll blow this can of yours sky high and
all of us with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you,&rdquo; said Dave with a touch of scorn.
&ldquo;See! There&rsquo;s a fisherman&rsquo;s boat coming to
meet us. We&rsquo;ll send you on to Chippewa with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that the man subsided into silence. As
the small boat pulled closer, Dave saw that
Captain Frey, in charge of the camp, was on
board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming in,&rdquo; Dave shouted cheerfully.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a good pump and an inch-and-a-half
hose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; was the young captain&rsquo;s
heartened response. &ldquo;You might save us. But
is it safe? How about the passengers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose boat is that?&rdquo; Dave asked, pointing
to the small fishing schooner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holgar Carlson&rsquo;s, from Chippewa,&rdquo; Frey
answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Holgar!&rdquo; Dave called. &ldquo;How much
to carry ten passengers to Chippewa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I tank mebby ten dollar,&rdquo; Holgar
drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Come alongside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; Dave waved a greenback when all
passengers had been transferred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t. This is on us,&rdquo; and Captain
Frey slipped a bill in the fisherman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he commented a moment
later, as he stood beside Florence on
the <i>Wanderer</i>, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never know what this
means to us. We&rsquo;ve worked so hard getting
a camp. Rain, cold, swamps, mosquitoes&mdash;it
sure has been tough on the boys, and now
this!&rdquo; His arms swept a wide circle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
not to blame for the fire. The boys were here,
all of them. They didn&rsquo;t set it. It just came
creeping down upon us from nowhere. The
boys have been fighting it for hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time after that, as guided by Indian
John&rsquo;s skillful hand the boat glided shoreward,
nothing further was said. Once, as the wind
veered, a heavy cloud of yellow smoke engulfed
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-o,&rdquo; Florence gasped, trying to breathe.
&ldquo;This&mdash;this is terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what the boys have been up against
for hours,&rdquo; Captain Frey said quietly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
be out of it in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Florence looked at the captain she
thought, &ldquo;Efficient, brave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a spectacle of the great fire caught
her eye, and she gasped with astonishment.
One moment a great fifty-foot, moss-covered
spruce tree stood proudly against the sky, the
next, with a loud roar, flames rushed from
its roots to the topmost branch. &ldquo;Alight, like
a giant candle,&rdquo; Florence exclaimed, &ldquo;and
there are thousands of them on the island!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the young captain replied. &ldquo;Close
to our camp they stand some distance apart.
If only we can wet down the earth about the
camp, keep the fire from creeping, then turn
the hose on it when it comes, we&rsquo;ll win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will,&rdquo; Dave exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got a marvelous pump. If only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only you can get in close enough.&rdquo;
The captain stood up and stared ahead. &ldquo;How
large is this boat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty feet long, by twenty wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; the captain replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
there is room. The water along the shore is
deep, thirty feet. A little way out are shoals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll slide right in there near shore,&rdquo; Dave
took the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a close little berth,&rdquo; he said five minutes
later, as Rufus, their young engineer, suddenly
put the engine into reverse. &ldquo;Rocks before
us, rocks to right and left. It&rsquo;s like cruising
in a bath tub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dropped anchor, let down their lifeboat,
sent the hose ashore, then started the
pump. At once a powerful stream of water
was busy soaking down the dry, moss-covered
earth. At times it set up a terrific sizzling
sputter, as it played on a tree that had
just caught fire.</p>
<p>Encouraged by these reinforcements, the
loyal band of camp workers, toiling with ax
and shovel, redoubled their efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we make it?&rdquo; Florence asked anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; was Captain Frey&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;If
the fire gets by us here, the whole island may
go. Think what that means! A forty-mile
long island covered with virgin timber, last
stand of primeval beauty, future playground
of thousands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed, &ldquo;it does mean a
great deal.&rdquo; Then, and for weeks to come,
she forgot her own disappointments, her lost
hopes, whenever she thought of this larger
cause which meant so much to many.</p>
<p>For two long hours, with the heat at times
growing all but unbearable, with the peril of a
gasoline explosion ever threatening, the boat&rsquo;s
pump chugged on.</p>
<p>There came a time at last, however, when
the weary fighters leaned on shovel handles
and watched the flames fade. Then there rose
a glad shout: &ldquo;The wind! The wind! It&rsquo;s
changed. It will drive the fire into the bay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was true. The wind had changed.
But Dave&rsquo;s brow wrinkled. He and Florence
were for the moment on shore. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get the boat out
of the bay. In a half-hour that fire will be
dangerously close to the boat and our gasoline.
It&rsquo;s swung round their camp&mdash;that&rsquo;s
safe. But it&rsquo;s coming our way with the wind
up. Our pump won&rsquo;t stop it. In an hour&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>He did not finish. Instead, he rowed swiftly
across to the <i>Wanderer</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rufus!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Cut off the pump.
Their battle&rsquo;s won. Pull in the hose. We&rsquo;ll
back out of here in a jiffy and be away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. Thanks more than we can say,&rdquo;
Captain Frey shouted hoarsely from the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say-ee!&rdquo; Dave stared down at the water
before the prow. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve shifted. Current carried
us in. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not have long to wonder. As Rufus
set the motor roaring, the boat&rsquo;s propeller
stirred up a great, white mass of foam, but
the boat moved never an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grounded!&rdquo; Dave groaned. &ldquo;Stuck between
two rocks. We&rsquo;ll never get off with our
own power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; Florence was almost in
tears. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried to help, and now this!
The fire is coming! The boat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Captain Frey shouted from
the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aground,&rdquo; Dave called back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; The captain sprang toward the
slope where the campers were resting.</p>
<p>A moment later, Florence felt her throat
tighten as she watched the weary boys swarming
shoreward. The hose was carried to land,
and this time the pump did double duty. The
boat rocked with the throbbing of its motors.
With a heart that at all times seemed to stand
still, the girl saw the bravest of the boys in
blue overalls force the nozzle of the hose almost
upon the onrushing fire.</p>
<p>Was the stream of water large enough?
Would the fire be stopped before it was too
late? For a time it seemed that, with the hose
alone, the fire might be conquered. Then, of
a sudden, a fresh and stronger gale sweeping
across the bay sent bright flames leaping along
the spruce trees and into the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lose,&rdquo; Florence choked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try the motor again!&rdquo; Dave ordered. &ldquo;We
might get away now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engines were accelerated, but in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting pretty hot down there.&rdquo; Rufus
mopped his brow as he came up from below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>A wave of despair overwhelmed Florence.
What would be the end? Then a thrilling
sight met her gaze. Fifty boys, each carrying
a shovel or an ax and each with his head covered
by a damp cloth, marched out of the camp
cabin and straight toward the conflagration.
&ldquo;To do or to die for us,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Then the boys struck up a song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />THE BATTLE OF SISKOWIT</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Battle of Siskowit,&rdquo; as the boys
later named it, was gloriously fought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; Florence exclaimed, as she
watched one band of weary smoke-choked
fighters fall back only to be replaced by fresh
shock troops, &ldquo;to think that those boys are
willing to risk and endure so much to save us
and our boat! What does it matter now if we
never make a dollar from this summer&rsquo;s
work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were times in that hour of fire fighting
when the battle seemed lost; when tall
spruce trees, caught in the flames, blazed toward
the sky; when the heat burned the faces
of the fighters and tar oozed up from the
<i>Wanderer&rsquo;s</i> deck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Three times Rufus went below to set the
motors roaring in the hope that some small
tide had lifted the ship off the rocks, but his
efforts were in vain. The <i>Wanderer</i> stuck fast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with fresh wet cloths to protect
their faces from the blistering heat, some of
the camp boys were swinging axes, clearing
a broad fire lane, while others had dug a deep
trench and were filling it with water to defeat
the creeping flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;ll make it,&rdquo; Florence breathed.
&ldquo;The wind is falling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later she, too, was obliged to
hold a damp cloth before her eyes. A sudden
fierce gust had thrown a shower of sparks on
the deck of their boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; Dave shouted. &ldquo;Buckets and
mops! We must wet down the deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later they were breathing
more easily. The fire had reached the last
tree standing before the lane that had been
cut to stop the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will it stop there,&rdquo; the girl questioned
anxiously, &ldquo;or will it jump the gap? If it does,
we&rsquo;re lost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Slowly but surely, as if by a miracle, the
flames died down. With a shout of victory on
their lips, a troop of workers sprang at the
charred tree trunks which still stood flaming
and threatening at any moment to fall across
the gap. With sparks falling all about them,
with smoking garments and parched faces,
the boys hacked and pushed until the last fiery
pillar lay flat upon the earth, its burning
tinder extinguished. Only then did all join in
a hoarse shout of triumph, Dave sounding the
boat siren to heighten the note of rejoicing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think,&rdquo; there was a suggestion of tears
in Florence&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;Grandfather&rsquo;s boat is
worth fifteen thousand dollars, and we might
have lost it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been blown to splinters of
wood and a mass of twisted steel,&rdquo; Dave
agreed. &ldquo;We should be thankful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go ashore and hold a jubilee,&rdquo; Florence
exclaimed.</p>
<p>This, for two reasons, they did not do. Half
the would-be celebrators were at once dispatched
to a point where the fire still threatened
to outflank them, and at the same time a
slim, powerful motor-boat, Patrol Boat No. 1,
rounded the point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yo-ho there!&rdquo; cried the skipper. &ldquo;What are
you lying here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been helping a little,&rdquo; Dave replied modestly.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re on the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hard?&rdquo; the skipper asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! We&rsquo;ll have you off in a twinkle.
Stand by to take a rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rope was thrown and attached to the
<i>Wanderer&rsquo;s</i> stern. The motors of the patrol
boat roared, and the grounded craft moved
slowly backward off the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy there!&rdquo; Dave shouted joyously.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be all right now. Thanks a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Wanderer</i> had lost a little paint from
her bottom, that was all, and as the boat&rsquo;s
prow headed for Chippewa Harbor, Florence
sat down for a breathing spell before going
below to prepare the evening meal. The look
on her face was a sober one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,&rdquo;
she said aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have to live only today,&rdquo; Dave said
as he appeared on deck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only today,&rdquo; she smiled up at him, &ldquo;and
that&mdash;why that&rsquo;s wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later when Dave emerged
from a little wireless cabin he had arranged
on the afterdeck, he held two slips of paper
in his hand. &ldquo;Important messages,&rdquo; he announced.
There was a hint of mystery in his
voice. He held out a paper on which she read:
&ldquo;Your passengers have been taken to Rock
Harbor. Signed: Ve and Vi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was from Vivian and Violet Carlson,
daughters of a fisherman. It meant that the
<i>Wanderer</i> could proceed at once to Rock Harbor,
unload freight, swing around to Tobin&rsquo;s
Harbor and Belle Isle, then head back to the
mainland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only,&rdquo; Florence thought. What question
was in her mind? Perhaps she could not
have told. She was for the moment oppressed
by a feeling of impending catastrophy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>The second message, picked up by chance,
was strange. &ldquo;Important message,&rdquo; it began.
&ldquo;To all lodgekeepers and to all captains of
ships touching at Isle Royale: Be on the lookout
for red-and-black boat powered by heavy
outboard motor. Tall gray-haired man and
girl of sixteen on board. They are believed to
have left Port Arthur for Isle Royale two
days ago. Nothing has been heard from them.
Be on the lookout. Important. Be on the lookout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Port Arthur. Forty miles of Lake
Superior,&rdquo; Dave said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Weather&rsquo;s
been pretty good. They should have made
it. We&rsquo;ll be on the lookout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later Florence dropped down upon
a box of life preservers to watch the stars
come out. Far off, dim, indistinct, but suggesting
all manner of strange mysteries, could
be seen the rocky, all-but-uninhabited shores
of Isle Royale. Here there might be a fisherman&rsquo;s
cabin and there an abandoned lighthouse;
there the shack of a recluse who mended
boats; and there, nestling along the shores
of a snug little harbor, the cottages of a small
lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not three hundred people on the entire
end of the island,&rdquo; she said, as Dave passed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And not many coming,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;Just
think! They told us there would be thousands.
And they never said,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that the
<i>Iroquois</i>, three times the length of our poor,
little bouncing tub, would be coming here
three times a week. We&rsquo;re stuck all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and yet&mdash;&rdquo; Florence sighed. &ldquo;Well,
it&rsquo;s one grand vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;What about the fire at Siskowit?&rdquo; Cottagers,
fishermen, lodge people and their
guests swarmed the dock at Rock Harbor on
the arrival of the <i>Wanderer</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We licked it,&rdquo; Dave reassured them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did,&rdquo; exclaimed a skeptical old-timer.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t lick a fire on this island in
that short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;It creeps
along on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and under the ground,&rdquo; added a third.
&ldquo;All our soil is of vegetable origin. Dry as it
is here, everything but the rocks burn. I&rsquo;ve
seen holes burned four feet deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four feet!&rdquo; Dave stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No kiddin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the man insisted. &ldquo;Question
is, what&rsquo;s going to be done about it? This
island is a national park. Are a pack of boys
going to be allowed to burn it up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I take it,&rdquo; said Dave soberly, &ldquo;that you are
referring to the camp boys at Siskowit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Dave, still speaking slowly,
&ldquo;all I&rsquo;ve got to say is that, in a time like this,
little talk and much thinking should be the
order of the day. Captain Frey says his boys
didn&rsquo;t set the fire. I believe him. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more,&rdquo; Dave broke in, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
just seen those boys put up a fight to save
their camp and our boat that would have done
credit to seasoned fire fighters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave stood six feet in his stockings. He had
a sharp, penetrating eye. There was that
about his tone at this moment that brought
the argument to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said a sturdily-built old man,
known to all at Rock Harbor as the Commodore.
&ldquo;Run your boat into Snug Harbor. Water&rsquo;s
deep there. You&rsquo;ll tie up for the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no.&rdquo; It was Florence who started
to speak, then stopped. They had meant to
go on but she was weary from the day&rsquo;s
battle, and so, too, were her companions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A few hours&rsquo; rest,&rdquo; she thought with a
sigh. Then a question came to her, &ldquo;What
of the mysterious man who had insisted that
they pass up the &lsquo;Battle of Siskowit&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a boat coming in soon,&rdquo; she heard
the Commodore telling Dave. &ldquo;A big pleasure
yacht from Chicago. She&rsquo;ll be tying up at the
big dock here. That&rsquo;s why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh sure,&rdquo; Dave broke in, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll slide into
Snug Harbor.&rdquo; He had sensed Florence&rsquo;s feelings.
They would stay for a while at least.
Florence heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A large pleasure yacht!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;That will be swell, just to look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to look at,&rdquo; Dave laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as
far as we&rsquo;ll get.&rdquo; He glanced down at his
smoke-blackened clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Commodore,&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.
&ldquo;What about that man? Did he go on the
<i>Iroquois</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo; The commodore stared at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A short, stout man with a dark face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recollect seeing him,&rdquo; was the reply.
Florence stared at the commodore, but
said no more. Somehow she had felt all along
that this man did not intend to leave the
island. But why? She could not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s still here,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Perhaps
back there somewhere in the dark just
now.&rdquo; The thought gave her a sudden turn.
&ldquo;But why should I care?&rdquo; she whispered almost
fiercely, &ldquo;Why should he wish to break
us? &lsquo;Break you&rsquo;&mdash;yes, those were his very
words.&rdquo; Dave had said they were broke. That
was not quite true. They were paying expenses.
That was something. But if someone
robbed them of their few passengers? What
then?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to leave the island,&rdquo; she
thought in sudden consternation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />BEAUTY AND A THREAT</h2>
<p>Slipping away from the main dock, the
<i>Wanderer</i> moved down the moonlit harbor
to find a berth close to the brightly lighted
lodge.</p>
<p>After a hasty meal of boiled potatoes and
trout fried in deep fat, topped off with coffee
and apple pie, Florence felt much better.</p>
<p>The little party went ashore. Dave and
Rufus soon settled down in a dark corner to
talk with fishermen about boats, motors and
the latest catch of fish.</p>
<p>Florence stole off alone to wander down
the narrow path that leads to the main dock.
Hanging high, the moon shining between the
birch trees painted patches of gold on the
path. The strong smell of damp earth, mingled
with the heavy odor of thimbleberries
in bloom, greeted her at every turn. The cool
damp of the night made her shiver with
sheer joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After all that stifling heat,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Arrived at a spot close to the dock, she
turned to one side, climbed a steep slope,
scrambled up the side of a great rock, then
with hands clasped about her knees, sat looking
away at the moonlit harbor that, stretching
away and away in that darkness, seemed
never to end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glorious!&rdquo; Suddenly she sprang to her feet
to swing her arms wide and to drink in the
cool air of night as some famished one fresh
from the desert might drink cold water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How perfect to live here,&rdquo; she breathed.
&ldquo;Never too hot nor too cold, and always, always,
so beautiful!&rdquo; And it was beautiful&mdash;jagged
rocks here, primeval forest there and,
far as eye could see, the deep, dark, mysterious
waters of Superior.</p>
<p>Yet, even as she stood there, she saw, as in
an evil dream, the threat. For, from the far-off
shores of Siskowit just then a distant red
gleam caught her eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fire!&rdquo; she exclaimed breathlessly.</p>
<p>It was true, even as she watched, like the
flash of a distant lighthouse, there came a flare
that increased in intensity for an instant, then
went black.</p>
<p>All too well she knew the meaning of that;
those boys had worked hard, but had not entirely
won their battle.</p>
<p>A moment passed, then came a second flash.
And after that another.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, the girl started. She had
spied a movement in the bushes close to her
rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>For the space of a second there came no answer.
Then a voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them is spruce trees. Dey go up in fire
like dat&mdash;you have been dere&mdash;you have seen.
Dey is burning yet. And dey will burn. Dey
will burn de whole island. Oh, ya. Dese fires
dey is bein&rsquo; set by somebody. Oh ya, dey iss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; the girl asked, almost in a whisper.
&ldquo;Why would anyone wish to set a forest
fire on this beautiful island?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>There came no answer, only a movement
in the brush. The speaker, whoever he might
have been, was gone. A strange thrill ran up
her spine.</p>
<p>But now the sound of distant music reached
her ear, and, as she strained her eyes, she
caught the gleam of a moving light. It was
over the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yacht,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It is coming.&rdquo;
Once again she settled herself comfortably
on her rock to watch the boat&rsquo;s light grow
brighter and brighter, to catch the rise and
fall of music that appeared to sway with the
boat and at last to hear the deep, mysterious
sound, the call of a boat in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How often,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;that haunting
sound has come drifting in out of the night,
the voice of a ship lost in the fog, or in distress
on the rocks. But tonight,&rdquo; once again
she stood up to fling her arms wide, &ldquo;Tonight
it is a call of pure joy, a call to a grand good
time on the deck of a beautiful yacht. But
then I wonder,&rdquo; she dropped back to her rock,
to wonder some more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>It was true that once a boat docked anywhere
on this friendly island, the cottagers
and lodge guests swarmed aboard. They were
always welcome. But she was not dressed for
such an occasion. All her party clothes were
on shore. She looked at her smoke-browned
slacks, at her blouse torn at the sleeve, then
murmured with a low laugh, &ldquo;Invitation to
the dance. But not for me. I&rsquo;ll be a spectator.
They won&rsquo;t even know I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a large white yacht that at last tied
up at the dock.</p>
<p>Sounding out in the silent night and across
the dark, mysterious bay that lay beneath the
stars, the music was enchanting.</p>
<p>The wail of violins, the tum-tum-tum of the
bases, the organ-like roll of a piano accordion
all seemed to blend with the beauty of the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s glorious!&rdquo; Florence whispered.</p>
<p>At that instant once again her eyes caught
and were held by that faint red threat against
the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire!&rdquo; she exclaimed softly. &ldquo;Must all
this beauty vanish? No!&rdquo; Her hands were
tight clinched now. &ldquo;No! It must not. At
all cost we must save the island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>But now there was a stir on the deck of the
yacht. Something unusual was about to happen.
What that was, for the moment, she
could not tell.</p>
<p>She gave herself over to speculation regarding
the people on that boat. Were they rich?
Some of them must be. The yacht was magnificent
in its burnished brass and polished
mahogany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all are rich,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Some
are guests of honor, famous people perhaps,
artists, writers, musicians, dancers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had she whispered this last word
when the orchestra began the low rhythmic
notes of a gypsy song she knew all too well,
and at once a slim, spirit-like figure, clad in a
gown that shone like silver in the moonlight,
glided out upon the deck and began to dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne!&rdquo; The sound that escaped Florence&rsquo;s
lips was almost a cry. &ldquo;Petite Jeanne!
It can be no one else. No one can do those
gypsy dances so divinely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>As she sat there entranced, listening to the
enchanting music, watching each gliding
movement of the dancer, she became more
and more convinced that her good pal of other
days, the little French girl, Petite Jeanne, was
really there within a stone&rsquo;s throw of her,
dancing as she had never danced before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne, who had been adopted by gypsies,
had at last found true kinfolks in France. She
had inherited an ancient castle. Florence believed
her rich. And yet here she was, dancing
as in those old golden days when they
were all very poor and happy together.</p>
<p>Involuntarily Florence allowed her mind
to drift back over days that were gone. She
saw Jeanne dancing with a bear, before the
hedges of France, saw her in the wilds of this
very northland, and then in a poor tenement of
Chicago. She rejoiced with her again as she
recalled her success and triumph as a dancer
in light opera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo; she whispered. She was unable
to answer her own question, but her
heart yearned to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she is still rich,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;This may be her own yacht. She may be
dancing for her guests.&rdquo; Of this she could not
be sure. One resolve she made at once, Jeanne
should not be disturbed by an old friend in
soiled slacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very soon,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;the yacht will
leave the dock, the music grow faint in the distance,
and Jeanne, like a spirit, will float away
into the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a spirit,&rdquo; she repeated musingly.
&ldquo;Jeanne was always like that, always kind, a
great friend, but never quite like other humans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dance went on. Again and again, in
response to applause, the swaying figure returned
to the deck.</p>
<p>There came at last a time when neither
applause nor bewitching music could lure her
from her retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is gone,&rdquo; Florence thought, in a
dreamy mood, &ldquo;disappeared down a moonbeam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>How true this was she was to know soon
enough. The deck of the boat was all aglow,
but the broad dock was in the shadows. Hidden
by these shadows was a little group of onlookers&mdash;a
cook from the lodge, two roustabouts,
a sailor or two. With them were Dave
and Rufus. Gliding along in the shadows a
slender figure approached this group, whispered
a question or two, received her answers,
then vanished into the night.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, to her great astonishment,
Florence heard her name called ever
so softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence! Florence! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big girl thrilled to her fingertips, but
did not answer at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; again the low silvery voice
called. &ldquo;Where are you? It is I, Petite Jeanne.
I have come all this way to find you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; The big girl&rsquo;s voice was husky.
She was on her feet now. Tears of joy were in
her eyes. &ldquo;Here. On the rock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Jeanne murmured, quoting from a
very old book, &ldquo;Lead me to a rock that is higher
than I.&rdquo; And then they who had had so
many adventures together were in each other&rsquo;s
arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />PLUMDUM</h2>
<p>&ldquo;But Jeanne!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed a half-hour
later. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come with us!
You truly can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Can I not?&rdquo; Jeanne stood up slim
and straight as a silver moonbeam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Florence tried to be firm.
&ldquo;We are going into a battle. The island is
on fire. It will be a battle of storm, flame and
smoke. But we must save our beautiful island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it not my island?&rdquo; Jeanne demanded.
&ldquo;Did I not live in a wrecked ship off
its very shores? And were you not my very
good companion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed, &ldquo;but now you belong
to France.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;France,&rdquo; the little French girl&rsquo;s voice
dropped, &ldquo;In my so beautiful France everyone
is poor again. No rich American will
rent my gloomy castle. So&mdash;&rdquo; she breathed,
&ldquo;So here I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have rich friends,&rdquo; Florence suggested,
nodding toward the yacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh these!&rdquo; Jeanne tossed her fair head.
&ldquo;Yes, these are friends. They are very kind
indeed. They like me to dance so they bring
me with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good people they are, too,&rdquo; she added,
more quietly. &ldquo;Some are very famous. One
writes books, one paints pictures of great
rocks, one goes to cold, cold, countries to explore
and one he is very rich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;You are my
friend of many, many days. It is in the lines
of our hands, it is written in the stars, that we
shall be together. Always and always!&rdquo; Her
voice rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&mdash;all right,&rdquo; Florence surrendered.
&ldquo;Have you any clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yes!&rdquo; the little French girl exclaimed,
&ldquo;I am prepared. In my locker are slacks of
midnight blue. And my blouses, they are
orange. Like a flame of fire are these.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like a flame,&rdquo; Florence laughed. &ldquo;All too
soon they will be like smoke. Look!&rdquo; Springing
to her feet, she pointed down the bay,
&ldquo;See! There is your flame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the red threat against the
sky flared anew. Jeanne shuddered. As for
Florence, she was thinking of the boys back
there fighting the flames in the night, thinking,
too, of the gay party on the rich man&rsquo;s
yacht, of young men in white flannels and
girls in evening gowns. Then, down deep in
her heart, a great wonder possessed her.</p>
<p>Of a sudden her thoughts were brought
back to her immediate surroundings. Bobbing
up and down in the low bushes beneath the
rock some creature came racing toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-what on earth is that?&rdquo; Florence
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s Plumdum,&rdquo; Jeanne cried. Sliding
off the rocks, she gathered some wriggling,
woolly creature in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t let him out when I dance. He
wants to dance and doesn&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Plumdum?&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.
&ldquo;What is he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just my dog,&rdquo; said Jeanne, holding him
up to view. &ldquo;My very good friend Plumdum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny name,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;How do you
spell it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; Jeanne giggled, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t give
him the name. It was a redcap in a railroad
station who gave it to him, though I guess
he didn&rsquo;t mean to. He&rsquo;s the one who told me
how to spell it too. But I guess he didn&rsquo;t
really know how, not really&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; Florence exploded, &ldquo;What you&rsquo;re
saying doesn&rsquo;t make sense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Jeanne apologized, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
how it was. I had fallen in love with this dog;
saw him in a pet store window. He&mdash;he sort
of winked at me, so I just went in and bought
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Florence agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Jeanne heaved a sigh, &ldquo;he
didn&rsquo;t have any name. Well I went into the
railway station and the redcap took the beast
and tried to steer him through the crowd. He
kept dodging between people and under their
feet. At last the redcap got disgusted and
said, &lsquo;Miss, that thar dorg is plumdum!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is he?&rsquo; I asked. I was all excited. I
thought that was his real name. Guess <i>I</i> was
dumb. But I said, &lsquo;How do you spell it?&rsquo; He
said, &lsquo;What Miss?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Plumdum.&rsquo; He said,
&lsquo;Miss, I ain&rsquo;t never been no spellin&rsquo; champeen,
but near as I can figger it&rsquo;s P-l-u-m-d-u-m.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was trying to tell you your dog was
plumb dumb,&rdquo; Florence laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure,&rdquo; Jeanne answered. &ldquo;All
the same, that&rsquo;s his name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does it fit?&rdquo; asked Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; Jeanne replied slowly.
&ldquo;Sometimes he&rsquo;s almost human.&rdquo; This last
Florence was to learn in the days that were
to come. In the drama of one crowded hour
Plumdum was to play an important role.</p>
<p>But now Florence sprang to her feet, &ldquo;Come
on!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going with us
you&rsquo;ll have to get your things together, dark
blue slacks, orange blouses&mdash;everything.
We&rsquo;re going to Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo; Jeanne demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bon! Mon cher. Tout de suite!</i>&rdquo; Jeanne was
off the rocks and away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Following slowly, Florence at last reached
the docks. There among the shadows she
came upon a young man, little more than a
boy. He was standing there looking away at
the midnight fire.</p>
<p>She had time to think, &ldquo;Interesting profile,&rdquo;
then he turned around and saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, sister,&rdquo; he said in a friendly voice.
&ldquo;Where did you come from? What do you
do here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We take people from here to there and
back again,&rdquo; she laughed quietly. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;sometimes we fight fires. Today we
had a terrific battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire? Where?&rdquo; The young man seemed
surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look.&rdquo; She led him to the opposite corner
of the dock, &ldquo;See that red spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire, all right,&rdquo; the other agreed. &ldquo;Will
they get it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; There was a sombre note
in the girl&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Just think! All this beauty,
and that fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking,&rdquo; said the young man soberly.
&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Florence did tell him, told of the day&rsquo;s battle,
told it with all the drama and feeling of
her emotional nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say-e-e!&rdquo; the young man exclaimed. &ldquo;That
will be a grand spot on my program! Will
you come to New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New&mdash;New York!&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;On
your program!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tim O&rsquo;Hara. I
plan and prepare radio programs. Just now
I&rsquo;m working on one to be called &lsquo;Adventurers&rsquo;
Club of the Air.&rsquo; Many people who have had
a real adventure will get a trip to New York,
all expenses paid, and a grand chance to tell
the story of their adventures to the nation,
coast to coast, seventy-nine stations. You&rsquo;ve
had a real adventure, why not come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Florence gasped. Then, &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t. Not now. Perhaps not for months.
There&rsquo;s going to be a battle, a terrific battle.
I&rsquo;m sure of it, and we&mdash;we must do our part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo; Tim voiced his
approval in no uncertain tones. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll
come, in the end&mdash;I know you will. New
York. Ever dream of that great city?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the radio? Coast to coast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll come and you&rsquo;ll have much
more to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I?&rdquo; The girl wondered and shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my card.&rdquo; He thrust a pasteboard
square into her hand. &ldquo;Guard it with care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next to my heart!&rdquo; she laughed as she
thrust it deep into her blouse pocket.</p>
<p>Then she caught Jeanne&rsquo;s call, &ldquo;Florence,
where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;We sail at once&mdash;&lsquo;Ships
that pass in the night.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes they meet again!&rdquo; His voice
was low. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor Florence experienced a
new thrill. Though the hour was near midnight,
the small dock was crowded. &ldquo;What
of the fire? What about the fire?&rdquo; they demanded
anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Close beside her, as she stood on the dock
telling of the fire, was a slender woman&mdash;a
fisherman&rsquo;s wife&mdash;listening intently. In her
arms she held a child. A second child tugged
at her skirts. Her all, Florence knew well, was
on Isle Royale. Across the narrow bay was
her spotless cabin and before the cabin a neat
fish house and many nets on reels. She and
her husband had toiled hard to build their
happy home, and now, if the fire came, all
would be lost.</p>
<p>Standing on the other side of her, leaning
on a cane, was a man well past eighty. Every
summer for forty years he had made a pilgrimage
to Isle Royale. His cabin stood overlooking
the rocks on the Point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are scores like him,&rdquo; the girl
thought. &ldquo;Some young, some old. If the fire
reaches their cabins, their joyous summers
will be at an end.&rdquo; Her gaze moved slowly
across the placid waters of the long, narrow
bay. Primeval forest, dark spruce and fir,
beautiful white birch ghosts in the moonlight
lined the shores. Suddenly something catching
her eye caused her to start. Beyond the
dark fringe of evergreen that lined the distant
horizon was a long, thin line of red. From
time to time, like a finger of fate, a pencil of
this red glow shot skyward, then faded into
the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave, look!&rdquo; she sought his attention.
&ldquo;The fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty and a threat!&rdquo; he murmured with
feeling. &ldquo;We must do what we can for these
people and their island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />NIGHT SIGNALS</h2>
<p>Three days later the <i>Wanderer</i> was at
Houghton on the mainland. Events had
moved rapidly. A strong gale had driven the
fire on the now flaming island beyond the
control of the small band of camp workers
who had volunteered anew to fight it. Rapidly
formed plans for a battle on a large scale
had already been laid. The <i>Iroquois</i> had been
taken off the run to the island. It was to carry
fire fighters and their supplies to hastily constructed
camps on Isle Royale shores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gives us a break,&rdquo; Florence, a born
optimist, exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would,&rdquo; Dave said, &ldquo;if anyone wanted to
go to the island, but this fire will scare them
away. Besides&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides what?&rdquo; Florence demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; Dave looked away, &ldquo;only,
do you remember that big man who was angry
because we went into Siskowit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him on the street today. He said, &lsquo;I
hear you&rsquo;ve only a sixty-day temporary permit.&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll renew it,&rsquo; and he said,
&lsquo;Oh, yeah? That&rsquo;s what you think!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll get it?&rdquo;
Florence asked soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; Dave replied.
&ldquo;One thing&rsquo;s sure, if they don&rsquo;t renew
it, we&rsquo;re sunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment they arrived at Houghton,
Florence wrote her grandfather.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been betrayed. We&rsquo;ve been led
into an unwise investment, and it was
your money. Even in good times there
are few passengers to the island. Now
there is a fire, and no one will come. I
can&rsquo;t tell you how sorry I am. There isn&rsquo;t
a chance that we shall more than break
even. Of course, with this threat of fire
there is opportunity for service. And how
it will be appreciated!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Continuing, she wrote of the kindly fisher-folk
whose cabins nestled among the trees,
and of the old time cottagers who made the
island their summer home.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If we stand by to help them off the
island in case disaster threatens, it will be,
I think, a great service. But will it pay?
What shall we do? It&rsquo;s your boat. You
must decide.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer came by return mail. &ldquo;Stand by
to serve,&rdquo; her grandfather wrote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;An opportunity to serve where service
is appreciated is a gift of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now something is happening to
you and, if I read your letter correctly,
you are taking it just as it should be taken.
And that is all that matters. Might
I add that life need never be a bitter
struggle. It may always be a glorious
adventure!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There his letter ended.</p>
<p>Florence read it, her heart swelling, &ldquo;Good
old granddaddy,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I only hope
we may yet find a way out.&rdquo; She was thinking
now of money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>The very next day, just as darkness was
falling, the <i>Wanderer</i> and her gallant crew
found themselves once more in a precarious
situation on Isle Royale. They were at Chippewa
Harbor. Here a brave little fishing family
had taken its stand against all sorts of
adversity and had won. Their neat home, their
stout little dock, and three tiny tourist cabins
showed all this. Of all the people on the
island, the Carlsons of Chippewa Harbor had
interested Florence most. Perhaps this was
because, unlike other fisher-folk of the island,
they did not leave when winter&rsquo;s ice threatened
to close their harbor. Instead, they ordered
many sacks of flour, sugar and potatoes.
To these were added hams and slabs of bacon,
cases of milk, fruit and vegetables and all else
that might be needed.</p>
<p>Then, with bleak winter winds blowing,
they settled down to six months of isolation.
During all that time, boats neither came nor
went. They were there alone. Isle Royale was
their home.</p>
<p>Working like beavers, they cut logs for
tourist cabins, mended their nets and made all
needed preparations for a successful season.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Besides the fisherman and his wife there
were Ve and Vi, as they called themselves,
girls of Florence&rsquo;s own age, and some younger
brothers&mdash;a happy family.</p>
<p>Chippewa Harbor, too, was a spot that had
made many a heart beat faster. A break in
the Island&rsquo;s rocky wall, it stretched back
through a narrow channel to a broader bay,
where giant spruce trees towered above massive
palisades. Here, in the still hour of evening,
one might rest on his oars to watch the
sun go down over the dark green treetops and
dream, transported to another world.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, Florence was ready to fight for
Chippewa Harbor. And at this moment it
was in great need of a champion. For by great
misfortune, this would be the first tiny settlement
to be reached by the fire if it came, and
at that moment it was coming fast. They could
see it crawling, leaping, rushing along the
ridges. They could hear it snapping and roaring
not two miles away. So sudden had been
its advance that no fire fighters had yet arrived.
Only the <i>Wanderer</i>, with her one small
pump, was standing by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>The entrance to Chippewa Harbor is narrow
and rocky. A storm was roaring in from
the lake. In an hour it might be impossible
for the <i>Wanderer</i> to leave the harbor. Perhaps,
too, in that hour, the roaring fire would be
upon the fishing village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the fisherman, scanning first
the fire, then the sky, &ldquo;that you better put
out into open water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your home, your cabins, everything
you have!&rdquo; Dave protested. &ldquo;Our pump may
save them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fisherman shrugged his shoulders, but
did not speak. About him was gathered his
family&mdash;his wife, Ve and Vi, and three small
sons. They, too, were strangely silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;We stay!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Darkness fell. Only the leaping flames
lighted the dark waters of the harbor. It was
a dramatic moment. Even Jeanne, always so
full of life and chatter, was silent. Indeed,
during the days that had passed, Jeanne had
seemed a little strange. She took small part in
their planning for the future. It was almost
as if she were an honored guest aboard the
<i>Wanderer</i>. The time was to come, however,
when she and Plumdum would do their bit.
But for the moment, even the curly-haired
dog, awed by the roaring lake waters close
by and the glare of the fire some distance
away, was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed in sudden consternation,
as she pointed toward the crest of
Greenstone Ridge that, rising a full three hundred
feet, extends from one end of Isle Royale
to the other. &ldquo;Look up there! A fresh fire is
starting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another fire,&rdquo; the fisherman murmured
hoarsely, &ldquo;how do they start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once Florence recalled those mysterious
words spoken in the dark&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Dese fires dey iss
bein&rsquo; set.&rsquo;&rdquo; Were they?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to blink,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;Strange
sort of fire, I&rsquo;d say. That&mdash;why, that&rsquo;s not a
fire!&rdquo; he exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;At least not
a forest fire. It&rsquo;s a campfire. Looks like a
signal fire as well. Watch! It&rsquo;s gone. Now
it&rsquo;s there again. Watch! And now&mdash;say!
They&rsquo;re signaling in Morse code. Wait! Let
me see if I can get their message!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>And so with the forest fire not two miles
away creeping toward them and roaring at
them, the little group, unable for the moment
to do anything to save themselves or property,
stood silent, watching, completely forgetting
their own troubles because of their interest in
others who might be in distress.</p>
<p>As for Florence, she was thinking of that
message which had become deeply impressed
upon her mind. The message, as you may
recall, had been concerned with a red-and-black
boat, a gray-haired man, and a girl of
sixteen.</p>
<p>This message once more passed through the
girl&rsquo;s mind, &ldquo;Important! To all lodgekeepers
and captains of ships touching at Isle Royale.
Be on the lookout for a red-and-black boat.
Tall, gray-haired man, girl of sixteen on board.
Important! Be on the lookout!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this their campfire up on that rocky
ridge?&rdquo; she asked herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It was Dave who spoke. &ldquo;They
must be in trouble. Their message is just one
word, &lsquo;Help!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what could have happened?&rdquo; demanded
Vi Carlson, one of the daughters of the fisherman.
&ldquo;All they&rsquo;ve got to do is come down
the ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but if one of them were sick or injured,&rdquo;
Florence&rsquo;s brow wrinkled. &ldquo;And see!&rdquo;
she cried in fresh alarm. &ldquo;There <i>is</i> a tongue
of flame farther down the ridge. There is a
second fire after all. If no one goes to help
them they may be trapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might go, you and I,&rdquo; Dave suggested.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a square of canvas. Might need it to
make a stretcher. Then we&rsquo;ll be off.&rdquo; He hurried
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a trail to Lake Ritchie and a moose
path up the ridge,&rdquo; Ve Carlson, the other
daughter of the fisherman volunteered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
show you the way. You&rsquo;d never find the
way by yourselves. Come on,&rdquo; Ve was off.</p>
<p>For a time, guided by the gleam of a flashlight,
they marched along in silence. Once a
moose sprang from the trail to go crashing
through the brush. &ldquo;A thousand moose on the
island,&rdquo; Florence thought. &ldquo;They may all be
destroyed by the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isle Royale has always been my home,&rdquo;
Vi broke the silence at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Always, winter and summer?&rdquo; Florence
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two winters we went to the mainland.
Since then, fish have been cheap. Times have
been hard. We couldn&rsquo;t afford to go. They
sent us a teacher, so we stayed here. We&rsquo;ve
graduated from high school,&rdquo; Vi laughed low,
&ldquo;my sister and I, in a log cabin school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go up here,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;The
moose trail is terrible, but we&mdash;we&rsquo;ll make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they did. With the beacon campfire
as their guide, they climbed until at last, with
a cry of victory, they burst in upon the astonished
and overjoyed campers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A red-and-black boat, a gray-haired man
and a sixteen-year-old girl,&rdquo; Florence quoted,
scarcely realizing what she was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got our number,&rdquo; laughed a tall,
thin, gray-haired man. &ldquo;But how did you
know all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been broadcasting about you for
days,&rdquo; said Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Grandfather!&rdquo; the strange girl exclaimed.
&ldquo;I told you they&rsquo;d find us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and for once I&rsquo;m glad to be found.&rdquo;
The man laughed low. &ldquo;This is growing a bit
thick&mdash;a fire to the right of us, one to the
left of us, and I not able to walk a step. Badly
sprained ankle,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;Beth and I decided
to make a secret visit to this beautiful island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather&rsquo;s always so busy,&rdquo; the girl
put in. &ldquo;So we just ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today was the first time we knew of the
fire,&rdquo; said the gray-haired man. &ldquo;Been on
the other side of the island. When we saw it
we got all excited, and I took the wrong kind
of step. So here we are. Looks dangerous
to me. Think we&rsquo;d better get going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; Dave looked away to the southwest.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to storm. Getting down&rsquo;s
going to be slow. The fire won&rsquo;t get here for
three hours at best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;d better weather the storm in the
little tent I carried on my back for just this
purpose.&rdquo; The old man smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Dave agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may have been wondering,&rdquo; the gray-haired
man said, after the tent had been set
up and they were comfortably seated inside,
&ldquo;why Beth didn&rsquo;t go for help, when she found
I could not walk properly. Truth is, she refused
to go.&rdquo; He chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; the girl demanded, &ldquo;The
fire was coming our way. There was no one
on our side of the island. We had been alone
there. I did see a light down on your side
but knew nothing about you people. Besides,
these trails are terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly no trails,&rdquo; Florence agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have been lost in some swamp.
The fire might have come while I was gone,&rdquo;
the girl shuddered. &ldquo;So, I stayed. At long
last, I might have been able to help him
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave girl,&rdquo; the old man placed a hand on
her shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>The changing scenes that passed before the
eyes of the small group on Greenstone Ridge
during the next hour would never be forgotten.
Below them, seeming so near that they
could reach out and touch them, were the
lights of the <i>Wanderer</i> and the fisherman&rsquo;s
cabin shining through the darkness. At a
greater distance, brilliant and menacing
against the blackness of evergreen forests and
water, was the fire. Creeping slowly, flaring
up here, dying down there, but ever moving
forward, it threatened in time to destroy Chippewa
Harbor&rsquo;s little world. Back of all this,
rolling in across the waters, was a storm.
Now faint flashes of light were seen. Low
rumbles were heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only it would rain hard!&rdquo; Florence
wished.</p>
<p>But what was this? Across the waters,
slowly moving lights approached Chippewa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; Dave shouted, as he read their
meaning. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ship. It must be Captain
Frey and his boys! Reinforcements!&rdquo; Fresh
hope shone in his eyes.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the lights of the newly-arrived
ship blended with those of the <i>Wanderer</i> than
there came a vivid flash, a roar of thunder,
and large, cold raindrops began to fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end,&rdquo; breathed Florence, &ldquo;the end
of our battle with the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the gray-haired man, wiser in
these things than the girl knew, &ldquo;it is not the
end, only a truce. The battle will be renewed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>How right he was the girl was soon to know.
The rain did not last long. It made little impression
on the blazing spruce trees. The wind
changed, however, driving the fire back, and
for the time being, Chippewa Harbor was safe.</p>
<p>Two hours later, after a hard but successful
struggle to bring the crippled man back
to civilization, Florence climbed wearily into
her bunk for a few snatches of sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />CHIPS</h2>
<p>Early as it was, when she came on deck
next morning Florence found the slim,
gray-haired man in a steamer chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;ve found you,&rdquo; she said with
a laugh, &ldquo;what do we do with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just anything,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you go from here,&rdquo; he asked,
&ldquo;and what do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We touch at the old lighthouse, where we
tell the fishermen that the fire is pretty bad,
but that we know hundreds of men are coming
to fight it, and we feel sure they&rsquo;ll win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo; He was still smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rock Harbor Lodge is next. We tell them
the same thing. Then Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor. We&rsquo;ll
tell them not to worry; that if the fire threatens
them, we&rsquo;ll be right there to take them
off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you get for all this?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she smiled back at him. &ldquo;That
is, no money&mdash;just satisfaction&mdash;heaps and
heaps of satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he looked at her in a puzzling manner,
&ldquo;after you&rsquo;ve done these acts of kindness,
you might run us round to McCargo&rsquo;s Cove
and pick up our small boat. We left it there.
You shall be paid in cash for this service,&rdquo;
he added with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; she queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you return to the mainland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must, for fuel and possible passengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll ride there with you. More
money!&rdquo; he laughed happily. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ll be
rolling in wealth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;we can pay for our
fuel, and that&rsquo;s something!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>As they made the rounds of fishing villages
and lodges that day, it was the same old story&mdash;worried,
anxious faces and whispered
rumors of disaster for all of them in the near
future. This brought the <i>Wanderer&rsquo;s</i> crew a
harvest of a sort. Lodge guests were anxious
to leave the island. It became evident that
when the boat headed for Houghton its decks
would be lined with paying passengers. This
brought a happy smile to the big girl&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she was thinking, &ldquo;things will not
be so bad after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Jeanne, she was the life of the party.
Donning a pair of coveralls miles too large for
her, she staged a ludicrous dance she called
&ldquo;The Deckhands Promenade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When at last guests dragged a fiddle and a
guitar from their baggage and sent a wailing,
thumping tune drifting across the dark waters,
she disappeared, to come popping out in
her silver robe, and to execute a true gypsy
dance that charmed her small audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne, you are a grand prize!&rdquo; Florence
exclaimed when she had finished. &ldquo;If only
there were no fire, and this were a regular
summer, you would charm all those land-loving
people into a visit to our island just
to see you dance!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; Jeanne replied soberly, &ldquo;perhaps
I shall yet dance before the flames and
lead them into the waters where they will
drown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed, with a laugh, &ldquo;the
way the Pied Piper led the rats into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly, things were looking up a little for
young Skipper Dave and his crew. One thing
was disturbing. Wherever they docked they
heard this complaint, hundreds of men were
arriving to fight the fire, the <i>Iroquois</i> was
bringing them, but there was lack of organization
and very little was being accomplished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Chips was here,&rdquo; said a grizzled
fisherman, as Dave and Florence left his dock.
Strangely enough, they heard this again and
again, always spoken by old men and with
great respect, &ldquo;If only Chips was here. If
only Chips&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave exclaimed at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sure like to be
that man Chips! Wonder if he&rsquo;s real, or only
a myth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; said Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>If Florence had hoped that the gray-haired
man whom they had rescued in such a dramatic
manner, with his granddaughter, from
Greenstone ridge, would, before leaving the
boat, reveal his identity, she was doomed to
disappointment. After paying his bill he gave
directions for having his boat and other belongings
taken ashore, then lost himself in the
crowd that lined the dock seeking information
regarding the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen the last of him,&rdquo; Dave
prophesied. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t on the island just
for a vacation, you may depend upon that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was Dave right? What would that mean
to their young lives if he were. To these questions
Florence could form no answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took in one hundred and forty dollars this
trip,&rdquo; Dave exulted as he walked into town
with Florence. &ldquo;First thing we know we&rsquo;ll
be making money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would they? For once Florence dared hope.
Perhaps this fire was a blessing in disguise.
With the <i>Iroquois</i> off the run, with army officers
and park officials in a hurry to reach
the island, and with a few daring souls still
ready to spend a short vacation on the island,
it did seem that they might hope. And yet,
before nightfall hope had vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>It was two hours after they had docked.
Florence was busy tidying up her galley when
a gay party of six, three men and their wives,
all attired in the latest sports togs, appeared
on the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the boat that goes to Isle Royale?&rdquo;
they asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo; Florence hesitated, &ldquo;perhaps
you haven&rsquo;t heard&mdash;the island&rsquo;s on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; one of the women
enthused. &ldquo;That makes it all the more exciting.
When do we sail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow evening at eight o&rsquo;clock is our
regular time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six round trip tickets,&rdquo; the girl was thinking.
&ldquo;Sixty dollars. And perhaps&mdash;yes, there
were three young officers coming down the
dock&mdash;ninety dollars. Wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But wait! There was a disturbance&mdash;the
stout man who had taken such a dislike to
Florence and Dave that first day of the fire,
drew one of the six would-be passengers aside.
Florence did not hear what he said, but, with
a sinking heart, she saw him pointing to a
large speedboat tied up at a smaller dock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>The man returned. There was a conference
among the six prospective passengers. Florence
caught only the words, &ldquo;Speedboat! How
thrilling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to Florence, the little lady with
the shining eyes said in an apologetic voice,
&ldquo;I&mdash;we&rsquo;re so sorry, dear. We&rsquo;ve decided to
take the speedboat. Think of it! We can be
over there in two hours, and it will be so
thrilling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence made no reply. What was there
to say? There was a sinking feeling at the
pit of her stomach. Her shoulders drooped.
&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;That man&rsquo;s going
into competition with us. He&rsquo;s got influence.
He&rsquo;ll see that our license to carry passengers
is not renewed. And yet,&rdquo; her body
stiffened, &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t keep us from serving the
people of the island. We can still stand by.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Then a strange thing happened. As the sunlight
slowly receded from the summit of Copper
Range, a short, stout man appeared on the
dock. To Florence his dress seemed odd. A
broad-brimmed black hat, blue shirt, overalls,
cut off six inches from the ground and not
hemmed, and high topped boots of coarse
leather clothed the man. What he said gave
her a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Chips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chips!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just plain Chips,&rdquo; the man corrected. &ldquo;I
want to go to Isle Royale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl exclaimed. &ldquo;They want you
and need you. The island is in flames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. When do we sail?&rdquo; Chips was
all business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ri-right away.&rdquo; Florence took one
bold fling at life. What would Dave say?
Turning about, she set her boat whistle waking
echoes among the sun-tipped hills.</p>
<p>Dave came on the run. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the rumpus?
What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, with as much dignity as
she could command, &ldquo;this is Chips. The island
needs him. We&rsquo;re sailing as soon as possible,
that is&mdash;&rdquo; her voice trailed off, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re
agreed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave said, &ldquo;O. K. by me,&rdquo; and it was done.
One passenger. Ten dollars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>This was not the last unusual incident of
that day&mdash;there was more to come. Chips had
gone for his luggage. Florence was slowly
pacing the deck when a girl shorter and broader
than herself appeared before her on the
dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Katie,&rdquo; said the girl. Florence knew
she must be a Finlander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katie who?&rdquo; Florence smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Katie Eskelund,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;And
I am going to Isle Royale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What place on Isle Royale?&rdquo; Florence
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Siskowit Bay.&rdquo; The girl lowered a heavy
blanket roll to the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s strong,&rdquo; Florence thought, &ldquo;strong
as a man. How she could send a boat through
the water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Siskowit?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There are no women
there. Only men and boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother is there,&rdquo; said Katie. &ldquo;He is
fighting fire. I shall stay with him. I can
fight fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! They won&rsquo;t let you,&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boys&rsquo; camp!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So-o,&rdquo; the Finnish girl&rsquo;s face clouded.
&ldquo;But my brother is there,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;We
are twins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Florence had some notion of what
it meant to be a twin. She wanted to help this
girl. But how?</p>
<p>Seized by a sudden inspiration she demanded,
&ldquo;Can you cook? Can you make pasties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Very good pasties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pasties! How Florence&rsquo;s mouth watered.
Good little turnover pies all filled with meat,
made only as the people of strange little Finland
knew how.</p>
<p>Just then Dave came up from below.
&ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; Florence smiled in spite of herself,
&ldquo;do you think we could use a cook on the
<i>Wanderer</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we might,&rdquo; Dave seemed a little puzzled.
&ldquo;Come to think of it,&rdquo; he added after a
brief pause, &ldquo;it would help. Looks to me as if
we were stepping into something rather big.
May be a day-and-night affair before we&rsquo;re
through. You&rsquo;re O.K. for a cook but not
twenty-four hours a day. And Jeanne, she&rsquo;s
fine, but a bit of a butterfly, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Florence agreed, &ldquo;anyway I
want you to meet Katie. She&rsquo;s no butterfly.&rdquo;
Katie grinned good-naturedly. &ldquo;She wants to
be our cook. She can make pasties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pasties. Oh! Boy!&rdquo; Dave grinned. &ldquo;Sure.
Take her on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can make bread, too,&rdquo; Katie volunteered
eagerly. &ldquo;Saffron buns and everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence did not know what saffron buns
were, but decided she could stand them at
least once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, with a note of finality,
&ldquo;you are hired. Then perhaps you will see
your brother now and then. You shall be our
cook. That is,&rdquo; her voice dropped, &ldquo;if you
want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer, Katie Eskelund tumbled her
blanketroll over the rail. That is how the
<i>Wanderer</i> came by a new cook. And she was
a cook indeed!</p>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock that same night Florence
awoke. She was wide-awake. A feeling that
all was not well disturbed her. What could it
be? Were they having engine trouble? Had
there been tampering on board? No, the motor
throbbed sweetly. Was there a storm?
Only a choppy sea that should have rocked
her to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>A breath of cold air brushed her cheek.
Her stateroom door was open. How come?
She sat up. The roll of the boat had banged
it open. But look! She now stared away at
the black waters. Had she caught a gleam
of light out there? It did not seem probable.
They were halfway across the lake, thirty-five
miles from anywhere. And yet&mdash;yes,
there it was! She saw it plainly now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It blinks!&rdquo; she exclaimed aloud. &ldquo;Distress
signal! Oh, dear!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;It seems as
if the whole world&rsquo;s in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly drawing on dressing gown and
slippers, she climbed out into the chill air of
night to find Dave in the pilothouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a light out there.
It blinks as if someone were in trouble. We&mdash;We&rsquo;ll
have to put about and go to his aid,
won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make a big pot of coffee.&rdquo;
Dave twisted the ship&rsquo;s wheel, turning the
<i>Wanderer</i> toward the signaling light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />RESCUED</h2>
<p>As the <i>Wanderer</i> came nearer to the blinking
signal of distress, it seemed more
and more certain that it was approaching
some light-buoy and not a boat at all. When
at last, however, the beams of the ship&rsquo;s lights
reached the spot, Florence smiled in spite of
herself, for the vessel in distress was none
other than the speedboat, that, having robbed
them of their passengers, had so joyously left
the harbor hours before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look at that!&rdquo; Dave exploded, as he
signaled for slow speed ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you! It&rsquo;s the <i>Wanderer</i>!&rdquo; a shrill
voice screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the little lady who was going to be
<i>so</i> thrilled,&rdquo; Florence remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t seem thrilled now,&rdquo; said Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably chilled instead,&rdquo; the girl shuddered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>And chilled it was. &ldquo;Just think!&rdquo; one
woman exclaimed, as she climbed stiffly on
board. &ldquo;The motor&rsquo;s dead. Probably it&rsquo;s going
to storm. The cold night. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not a blanket, nor bite to eat,&rdquo; added
another. &ldquo;It was perfectly frightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb right up and come into the cabin,&rdquo;
Florence invited cheerily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a roaring
fire and gallons of coffee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee! Hot coffee! Man! Oh, man!&rdquo; exclaimed
the leader of the party. &ldquo;Take us to
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my batteries,&rdquo; grumbled the stout
speedboat man, as he crowded into the cabin
after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Started out with bum batteries. That&rsquo;s
b-a-d.&rdquo; It was Chips who spoke. &ldquo;But I got
some that belong to pumps,&rdquo; he volunteered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend &rsquo;em to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for taking us on to Isle Royale,&rdquo; exclaimed
the leader of the party. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
through! No more speedboats for us. We
stay right here. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shouts of approval which rose at this
suggestion warmed Florence&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; the leader fairly bristled,
&ldquo;that money we paid you for the trip!&rdquo; he
shouted at the speedboat man. &ldquo;Shell out, or
we&rsquo;ll sue you for damages. That money goes
to this young skipper and her crew.&rdquo; He
turned to Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the skipper,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same. What do you say?&rdquo; he
turned on the speedboat man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; The man held out a roll of
bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, sister.&rdquo; After adding one
bill, the leader transferred the roll to Florence.
&ldquo;A bit extra for doughnuts and coffee
and&mdash;and as a penalty for our insulting a real
boat.&rdquo; At this they all laughed.</p>
<p>An hour later the <i>Wanderer</i> was once more
rolling on her way, and Florence was preparing
for ten more winks of sleep. Before her
eyes closed, however, her mind ran dreamily
to the mysterious Chips and the more mysterious
gray-haired man and the girl they had
rescued from Greenstone Ridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Dawn found the <i>Wanderer</i> and its passengers
at the island. Once they arrived, they
were not long in discovering that the man,
Chips, had not been over-advertised. Born
and bred in the north woods, a natural director
of men, he inspired confidence and hope everywhere.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he left the boat when he
asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your map? Now where are
the fires? There are hundreds of men on the
island. Where are they? That&rsquo;s good! This
is bad. Where are the patrol boats? Where&rsquo;s
the <i>Iroquois</i>? Move these men. Put pumps
there. We&rsquo;ll make a stand across here: Lake
Ritchie, Chickenbone Lake, and McCargo&rsquo;s
Cove. That line must hold. This end of the
island must be saved at all cost. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone did see at once; and little by little
order was being restored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve saved us,&rdquo; a bearded cottager
gripped Florence&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You young people
of the <i>Wanderer</i> did it. You brought us Chips.
You&rsquo;ve stood by. We&rsquo;ll not forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warmed by this speech and glowing with
hope, Florence turned to Dave and exclaimed,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win now. I know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Win what?&rdquo; Dave grinned good-naturedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll save the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that. I always knew we would.&rdquo; Dave
laughed.</p>
<p>And yet, would they? After one long, sober
thought, Florence was not so sure. There were
rumors of a third fire, started several miles
from the first two, near Tompsonite Bay, on
the farther end of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are these fires truly being set?&rdquo; the girl
asked herself. &ldquo;And if they are, why?&rdquo; For
the moment she found no answer.</p>
<p>After unloading a few groceries at Rock
Harbor, they went pop-popping round Schoville&rsquo;s
Point to Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor Landing, then
round to Belle Isle at the north side of the
island. Everywhere there was talk of fire, but
to Florence&rsquo;s growing astonishment she
caught no word suggesting that the fires
might have been set. At last, she all but dismissed
the thought from her mind. But not
for long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Isle Royale is forty miles long. The east
end broken up into points is like the fingers
on a man&rsquo;s hand. Blake&rsquo;s Point, which forms
the long middle finger, extends far out into
Lake Superior. It is here that sturdy fishermen
mumble a prayer on nights of storm and
fog, for the roar of breaking waves is like
the roar of the sea, and great gray walls seem
to reach out hands to drag them in.</p>
<p>Once, so we are told, a freighter, carried
away by a terrible storm, crushed head on
against this wall, and sank. She was loaded
with canned salmon. For a long time after
that the fishermen caught canned salmon in
their nets.</p>
<p>On this day as the <i>Wanderer</i> rounded this
point there was no storm. A lazy breeze
pushed a thin, gray haze before it. A seagull
soared high. A wild duck swimming before
their boat, eyed them for a moment, then
rose to go flapping away. Off to the left, perhaps
a mile, some objects, a little grayer than
the haze, appeared to glide back and forth
across the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Jeanne asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Phantom Fisherman,&rdquo; Florence said
with a low laugh. &ldquo;He is always there when
there is a fog. When you come near him, he
fades away into deeper fog.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; said Jeanne, charmed with
this note of mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably trolling for lake trout,&rdquo; said the
practical Dave. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reef out there
they call &lsquo;Five Foot&rsquo; because it comes within
five feet of the surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Phantom Fisherman,&rdquo; Jeanne repeated
dreamily.</p>
<p>And so, gliding along between narrow rocky
islands, they came once more to Tobin&rsquo;s Landing.
Here they meant to spend the night, and
perhaps all the next day. There was a suggestion
of storm in the air. A storm from the
southwest meant fanned flames and added
peril to all. Their great command at this moment
appeared to be, &ldquo;Stand by to serve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Tobin&rsquo;s harbor all was peace. In this
snug little bay the wind had gone to rest. As
evening came, the water was like glass. Here
spruce and balsam, growing down to the very
water&rsquo;s edge, cast dark green shadows, and
there, like fairy maidens in filmy dresses, white
birches appeared to bend over and look down
into the water&rsquo;s clear depths.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>When the gong sounded for the evening
meal, savory odors greeted the crew of the
<i>Wanderer</i>. Katie&rsquo;s pasties were all that the
heart might desire. The crust melted in one&rsquo;s
mouth and the meat was done to a turn.
When it came to her saffron buns, opinion
was divided. Jeanne, ever fond of new experiences,
pronounced their strange flavor
&ldquo;delicious!&rdquo; Florence ate them in brave silence,
while Dave turned his attention to
&ldquo;good old army bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Florence said in a low tone,
&ldquo;Katie is a dear, and she&rsquo;ll be a great help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dave agreed. &ldquo;And if we&rsquo;re ever
one man short, she can pinch-hit for the best
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As darkness began to fall, weary from the
night&rsquo;s adventure and the day&rsquo;s toil, Florence
sought her berth. But Jeanne, who, like the
crickets and katydids, always sang best at
night, went on the dock in search of some
new and interesting adventure.</p>
<p>She found it in the form of a man with a
mass of tangled gray hair and very bright
eyes, who sat on the dock, staring dreamily
at the moon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t see the fire tonight,&rdquo; he said
as he rose, and bowing politely, offered her
a seat beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s there all the same,&rdquo; Jeanne said, as
she dropped into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what do you speak?&rdquo; asked the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire,&rdquo; said Jeanne. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like some big,
red-faced giant, hiding behind the hills. Bye
and bye it will pop up all of a sudden and
roar at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said the man, with a
chuckle, &ldquo;but then, why worry about tomorrow?
When you are my age you&rsquo;ll know there
may be no tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No tomorrow?&rdquo; Jeanne tried to think what
that might be like and failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she exclaimed, as if to break
the spell, &ldquo;This is a land of primeval forests.
It should be one of ghosts, fairies, elves, just
any little people. Are there no legends about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, one,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Monument Rock?&rdquo; the old
man asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. I shall,&rdquo; said Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The legend is about Monument Rock,&rdquo; said
the old man. &ldquo;It is just over yonder. If it
were daytime I might point it out to you&mdash;the
rock, I mean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he settled back in his place, &ldquo;before
the white man came, no one lived on the
island, that is, hardly anyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians came in their great canoes to hunt
and to crack away rocks and gather great copper
nuggets which they beat into spear points
and arrowheads. But when the dark whispering
trees cast their shadows on the bay they
seemed to hear voices saying: &lsquo;This is no fit
place for man to live. This is the home of all
island gods.&rsquo; And always they hurried to their
canoes and went paddling away. That is,&rdquo; his
voice seemed to trail off, &ldquo;almost always.&rdquo;
From somewhere far away a faint echo murmured
&ldquo;Almost always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they sat there, the aged man and
the blonde-haired girl, lost in meditation, contemplating
the beauty of the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; the old man breathed at last. &ldquo;It is
magnificent, all this. God made it glorious
and man has done little to mar it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; his voice grew mellow, &ldquo;a few
years back, when there were more people here
and there were joyous young people with us,
we held a night party on the little island, just
over there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those young people sang beneath the
stars.&rdquo; His voice was low&mdash;&ldquo;They sang as no
one had sung before, sang to life, beauty and
joy, to God, who is all these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; he heaved a deep sigh, &ldquo;we
made a great bonfire. The wood was dry.
There was not a breath of air. The flames
rose straight up&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;till they reached
the stars. We were in touch with Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Jeanne breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the flames touched the stars, someone
in a boat coming down the bay started music.
What kind? I do not recall. Someone was
playing Kreisler&rsquo;s &lsquo;Old Refrain.&rsquo; Ah,&rdquo; he
breathed, &ldquo;it was the final touch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Late that night,&rdquo; his voice dropped, &ldquo;I
threw myself on my cot and said, &lsquo;Why should
I live longer? This is life&rsquo;s great moment!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; his voice rose again, &ldquo;there is
more of life&mdash;much more. And the way leads
up, always upward toward the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is late. I must be going.&rdquo; Springing
to his feet, the old man vanished into the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a strangely glorious old man!&rdquo;
Jeanne mused, as Dave came up. &ldquo;And, oh!&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;he was going to tell me the legend
of Monument Rock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is Doctor Emery,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;They
call him &lsquo;Dean of the Island.&rsquo; Perhaps he will
tell you that story tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Jeanne answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she thought to herself, &ldquo;it could
not be half so charming as it would have been,
told here beneath the stars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jeanne crept softly to her berth in Florence&rsquo;s
stateroom, Plumdum gave a low &ldquo;yip&mdash;yip.&rdquo;
He was silenced at once, but Florence,
wakened from her dreams, did not fall
asleep for some time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>As she listened to the sounds of the night,
the low tweet-tweet of the night bird, the
swish-swish of a moose swimming the bay
and the distant howl of a bush wolf, her mind
was crowded with thoughts that for the moment
seemed not connected at all.</p>
<p>There were the gray-haired old man and
his granddaughter whom they had rescued
from Greenstone Ridge. Who was he? And
would they meet again? There was the big
man whose speedboat had failed. Would he
try again? Would their license be renewed, or
would this man put an end to their work as
passenger carriers? And the fires? Were they
under control? Dared she hope this? She
dared not hope. Why had the voice in the
night said these fires had been set?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would they?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;How
could they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if in answer to her whisper,
a voice broke the silence of the night. &ldquo;Ya.
Dese fires dey iss bein&rsquo; set. Dey iss&mdash;no doubt
about dat. But who is setting dem? Dat&rsquo;s de
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same voice,&rdquo; Florence almost said
aloud. Springing from her berth barefooted,
in pajamas, she dashed out onto the deck to
send the gleam of her flashlight far and wide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one on the water,&rdquo; she whispered.
Shuddering, she crept back beneath
the blankets.</p>
<p>A moment later she heard footsteps on deck.
At first she thought it must be the mysterious
man. As she listened, however, she recognized
Dave&rsquo;s substantial tread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; he spoke through the latticed
window, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been going it rather strong
of late. Guess we&rsquo;ll take a half-day off. If
you and Jeanne have anything to do, you
might go at it in the morning. We won&rsquo;t
leave here before noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll go on some
sort of a hike. I&rsquo;m aching for a chance to
stretch my legs. They get all cramped up here
on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />MYSTERIOUS YOUTH</h2>
<p>Early next day, Florence and Jeanne
rowed across the bay to a small dock
marked, &ldquo;Monument Rock Trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After tying up their boat they took up the
trail that, now winding beneath sweet smelling
cedar and balsam, and now passing over
a swamp spanned by shaky logs, at last
brought them to the foot of a ridge. Here
they started climbing toward the crest.</p>
<p>Some half-way up they made an abrupt turn,
to find themselves facing a mass of towering
rock that, like the tall chimney of some burned
building, rose to the very tree tops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monument Rock,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered.
Something of that spell cast over her by the
&ldquo;Dean of the Island&rdquo; recurred now. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like
a headless man, that rock,&rdquo; she said in awed
voice. &ldquo;A man with hands folded across his
knees.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like the legend!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you know it?&rdquo; Jeanne was pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It goes like this,&rdquo; Florence began. &ldquo;In
the early days Indians seldom came to live
here. It was, they said, the home of all island
gods. If men came here to live they would
meet with disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any of them ever try it?&rdquo; Jeanne
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence smiled and nodded. &ldquo;This
one! &lsquo;Sitting Cloud&rsquo; they called him. He&rsquo;s
still sitting, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sitting Cloud,&rdquo; Jeanne said in a small
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You see, like lots of other people,
he didn&rsquo;t believe in gods, so he came here to
live. The hunting was good. There were caribou,
lynx and beaver in those days. He traded
lumps of copper to others of his tribe and got
on very well indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Jeanne breathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then he began to believe in the gods.
Sometimes, in a night of fog, he thought he
saw them creeping upon him. So he took to
hiding in a small cave that opened out right
at this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Jeanne repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he hunted very little. He did not
crack away rock to get copper. Indians who
came to visit the island found him shuddering
in his cave. You see, Jeanne,&rdquo; Florence
said soberly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what comes of believing
in island gods, fairies, gnomes, and all such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or, in not believing.&rdquo; Jeanne was quite
serious. &ldquo;Perhaps the island was <i>not</i> meant
to be lived upon,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Perhaps it
will all be burned over. Then no one can live
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but no!&rdquo; She sprang to her feet. &ldquo;It
is so beautiful! It is always so cool! The air
is so delightful! It must not be destroyed!
It truly must not be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this Indian, Sitting Cloud?&rdquo; Her voice
changed. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Florence looked toward the great rock towering
to the sky. &ldquo;Just what you see. Sitting
Cloud was a giant. Perhaps he had grown
since coming to the island. Anyway, so the
story goes, one spring his friends came to look
for him and all they found was this rock.
Even his cave was gone. The gods had turned
him to stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gods had turned him to stone.&rdquo; Jeanne
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure it was so!&rdquo; Jeanne declared.
&ldquo;But come!&rdquo; She seized Florence by the hand.
&ldquo;Let us go to the very top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again they took the upward trail.
They came at last to the crest of the ridge.
There, standing on a platform of rock known
as &ldquo;Lookout Louise,&rdquo; they stood in silence,
while their eyes took in the glorious view.</p>
<p>It was a clear day. At their feet lay Duncan&rsquo;s
Bay. On the little camping spot at its
entrance, more than once in the days that
had gone they had pitched their tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy days,&rdquo; Jeanne whispered.</p>
<p>If Florence heard, she made no reply. She
was looking away toward the Canadian shores
where Sleeping Giant, Pie Island, and Thunder
Bay seemed to call to her.</p>
<p>At that Jeanne broke in with three magic
words: &ldquo;The Phantom Fisherman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;You only
see him in a fog.&rdquo; The fact is, the big girl
scarcely believed in this phantom at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See for yourself!&rdquo; Seizing her arm, Jeanne
pointed away over the shimmering water to a
spot well beyond the last jagged end of the
island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;there he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough. Let&rsquo;s have a look.&rdquo; Florence
dragged a pair of heavy field glasses to her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems real enough,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;White boat with a red gunwale, sort of short
and chubby. I&rsquo;d know that boat anywhere.
What a powerful motor he must have! How
he does dart about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we were there he would vanish,&rdquo; Jeanne
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne, you&rsquo;re a dreamer.&rdquo; Florence let
the glasses drop to her side. &ldquo;But then, what
is one to expect from a gypsy, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant a cry escaped her lips.
&ldquo;Look! Only look, Jeanne!&rdquo; She had turned
half-about. &ldquo;Smoke everywhere! The whole
island is on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>This seemed indeed true. To judge distances
was difficult but it looked as though the nearest
fire must not be more than ten miles away.
Beyond that the whole island was hidden by
smoke.</p>
<p>Even as Jeanne looked, Florence exclaimed
again, &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again, dragging the heavy fieldglasses
to her eyes, she studied a mass of rocks that at
some distance rose above the treetops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;A man in a
bright red sweater. Must be five miles away,
where no one lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man had been leaping from rock to rock.
Now he paused to turn and look away. Did
Florence see a fresh column of smoke rise from
the evergreen forest? She thought so. She
could not be sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s young,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Perhaps only
a boy. Not even a middle-aged person could
go over the rocks like that. Can he be a firebug?
Are these fires being set by him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>To these questions there could be no answer
for the present. One thing was certain. If she
saw him again close by and he wore that
sweater, she would know him, for surely there
was but one such flash of red on the island.</p>
<p>Two hours later the girls were having lunch
with Edith Mateland, the wife of one of the
fishermen. She was a small person, and Florence
thought rather frail for such a life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edith,&rdquo; Florence said, &ldquo;do people ever
set forest fires?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Many times!&rdquo; was the startling
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they do not like the people who
own the timber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revenge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And perhaps they just want work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work?&rdquo; Florence stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Edith explained. &ldquo;These days
there are many who have no work. If there
is a very terrible fire men will be hired to fight
it. Thousands of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but these wouldn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been done many times.&rdquo; There was
a ring of truth in Edith&rsquo;s voice. She was of
the North. She knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Florence thought of the hundreds of men
being brought to the island to fight this fire.
One thing was certain. If there was a firebug
on this island he must be caught. She
would ask questions of people here and there
about the mysterious youth in the crimson
sweater. She would search far and wide for
him. If he seemed to avoid her she would
hunt him down. He should not escape. So,
fired by a new resolution, she rowed back to
the <i>Wanderer</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />THE DEFENSE OF CHIPPEWA</h2>
<p>She had barely reached the <i>Wanderer</i> when
a messenger, having raced over the two-mile
trail from Rock Harbor Lodge, appeared
on the shore. Quite out of breath, and greatly
excited, he shouted across the narrow stretch
of water,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, there! Chippewa Harbor is burning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Florence was startled. &ldquo;How do
you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a short wave message from Ve and
Vi, whoever they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ve and Vi,&rdquo; Florence said, &ldquo;they are the
fisherman&rsquo;s daughters. They have a short wave
outfit for winter use. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo;
she hesitated. Then she shouted across to the
messenger, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Chippewa? Only the fishermen and a
troop of boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys? What boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troop No. 18.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight-eighteen?&rdquo; The big girl&rsquo;s hopes
fell. She knew those boys. City bred, they
knew nothing of fire fighting. Two boys, Mike
and Tony&mdash;the worst of the lot&mdash;she suspected,
were their leaders. What was to be expected
from them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back and get a message to them. Tell
them we&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the good?&rdquo; Dave demurred,
as Ruth ordered the deck cleared for action.
&ldquo;If the place is burning what can be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know as well as I,&rdquo; Florence replied
rather sharply, &ldquo;that reports on this island
are always exaggerated. The least we can do
is to go over there and take the folks off.
Think of losing everything,&rdquo; she said in a sober
tone, &ldquo;Home, furnishings, everything&mdash;the
work of a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Soon they were skirting the rocky shores,
headed for Chippewa, sixteen miles away. Sitting
on the deck, Florence closed her eyes, and
tried to picture in her mind the snug little
harbor with its tiny huts, its toy-like log cabin
store and its little group of fishing folk. Had
she seen it all for the last time? It would seem
so, for as her eyes opened she saw a long
column of yellow smoke trailing out over the
lake. As they rounded a point some two miles
from the harbor, her anxiety increased. So
dense was the smoke that it did not seem
that one building could be left standing.</p>
<p>Imagine her surprise and joy when upon
rounding the final jutting of rock she beheld
Chippewa Harbor just as she had seen it last!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doomed, for all that,&rdquo; Dave said soberly.
&ldquo;Look at that line of fire not a half-mile off
and coming this way!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For once,&rdquo; he spoke slowly, &ldquo;the <i>Wanderer</i>
is going to run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! No! Not yet!&rdquo; Florence remonstrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but soon,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;When
we touch the dock you tell those folks to get
everything that&rsquo;s portable on the deck of this
boat without delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will they do it?&rdquo; All too well the girl
knew the stubborn determination of these
Scandinavian people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>To her surprise she found the fisher-folk
ready to comply. They had seen enough, were
ready to admit themselves beaten. Even the
troop of city boys, who knew nothing of fire
fighting, joined in the rescue work. In no
time at all the cottages, fishhouse and store
were stripped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about these?&rdquo; a boy asked, pointing
to several large boxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Government property,&rdquo; Florence decided.
&ldquo;They stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we go aboard?&rdquo; Mike, leader of
the boys&rsquo; troop, asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; Florence gave him a
strange smile. &ldquo;You, too, are government
property. Oh, you won&rsquo;t burn,&rdquo; she added,
as she saw the sullen look on the boy&rsquo;s face
deepen. &ldquo;All you have to do is run over the
ridge, climb down fifty feet, and find a good
place to rest. The fire will never touch you.
Besides&mdash;&rdquo; She did not finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Swing off. I&rsquo;m staying.&rdquo; There
was a bluntness about her tone, as for the
first time she gave Dave an order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why? You can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Dave did not finish.
She shot him a look. He had seen that
look on her face before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast off the line,&rdquo; he said. Shuffling to the
post, the boy called Tony lifted the line and
gave it a fling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Tony growled, giving Florence a
hard look. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re stayin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence did not answer, for at that moment
robust Katie appeared at the ship&rsquo;s rail.
One look at Florence and, boy-like, she vaulted
the rail, sailed over three feet of water, and
landed with a thud on the dock.</p>
<p>In sudden consternation, Florence saw that
Jeanne, too, was preparing to try the leap to
shore. By this time the distance was too great.
She would fall into the water and might be
injured by the boat&rsquo;s propeller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Jeanne!&rdquo; she screamed, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump.
Stay on the boat. They may need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughingly Jeanne held up her hands in
sign of surrender then disappeared down the
hatchway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re stayin&rsquo;, too?&rdquo; said the boy called
Mike turning to Katie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I&rsquo;m stayin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Katie. &ldquo;Maybe
we can lick that fire even if a whole army
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, now don&rsquo;t you get excited,&rdquo; said Mike,
with a leering grin. &ldquo;It takes men to fight a
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in those boxes?&rdquo; Florence demanded,
ignoring their banter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know exactly,&rdquo; said Tony. &ldquo;Mebby
they might be pumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pumps?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you open them up and see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Mike. &ldquo;Left yesterday.
We can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do a thing until he comes back!&rdquo;
There was biting sarcasm in Florence&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;Not if the whole island burned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we want,&rdquo; Tony jeered. &ldquo;Exactly
it. When it&rsquo;s all burned we can go back
to the mainland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookit,&rdquo; he waxed fairly eloquent, &ldquo;What
sort a place is this? Y&rsquo; can&rsquo;t crank up the
flivver on Saturday night and go to town
&rsquo;cause there ain&rsquo;t no flivver. An&rsquo; y&rsquo; can&rsquo;t go
see the girls and get a glass a beer &rsquo;cause there
ain&rsquo;t no gals and there ain&rsquo;t no beer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; said Florence, reaching for an
ax that was leaning against the dock house,
and giving one of the six boxes a sharp crack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; Tony exclaimed. &ldquo;Government
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; She swung her ax again, knocking
off a board. Crack&mdash;crack&mdash;crack. The
box broke away, revealing a neat contraption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a pump!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s eyes shone.
&ldquo;Any of you know how to run it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer. Her eyes wandered to the nearby
ridge. A giant spruce, ignited from below,
blazed clear to the sky in one terrifying
whash. Seizing the remains of the box, she
cast them into the bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like an outboard motor,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it was made
like one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! A rope to start it!&rdquo; exclaimed Katie,
grabbing a short rope with a wooden handle
attached. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get the devil for that!&rdquo; Mike threatened.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t fool with government property.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t and you don&rsquo;t want to!&rdquo; Florence
flared up. She was uncoiling a forty-foot
hose. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d rather let the island burn. It
might be a playground for thousands. Tired
people could rest here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, rest!&rdquo; Mike sneered, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d want
to rest? Go places! See things! That&rsquo;s me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve eaten Mrs. Carlson&rsquo;s doughnuts
and slept in her cabins when it was raining,
and now,&rdquo; Florence threw him a look of scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too fresh!&rdquo; With a threatening
gesture Tony moved closer along the edge of
the rock.</p>
<p>To all this Katie gave no heed. She had discovered
a small tank on the pump. This she
had filled with gasoline. Now she was fitting
the knot of the short rope into its place. If
this pump worked like an outboard motor
she could start it. And then&mdash;</p>
<p>Florence was thinking all this when with a
start, her mind was brought back to Mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think y&rsquo;re smart, don&rsquo;t yer?&rdquo; There was a
dangerous glint in his eye. He took a step
toward her&mdash;another, and another. &ldquo;Think
I&rsquo;m a guttersnipe, don&rsquo;t y&rsquo;&mdash;a tough city guy?
Well, that&rsquo;s what I am. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show y&rsquo;.&rdquo; He
took one more step.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Florence tried in vain to steady her
wildly beating-heart. &ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s not what
I think at all. I don&rsquo;t care where you came
from nor what you&rsquo;ve been. I only know what
you are now. What you&rsquo;re doing. Lying
down on your job&mdash;leading all these boys the
wrong way. You&rsquo;re ungrateful&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think yer smart,&rdquo; Mike stepped closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, Miss,&rdquo; a wavering voice
came from the line. It was the smallest, most
timid boy of the lot who spoke. And yet&mdash;he
had courage.</p>
<p>Swallowing hard, the girl tried to speak.
Words would not come. Mike&rsquo;s fists were
clenched hard as he moved one step nearer.
He was closely followed by Tony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him, Miss,&rdquo; came in that same
wavering voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>And then the thing happened. Three times,
all unknown to Florence, the powerful Katie
had pulled the rope that turned the wheel of
the strange pump that looked like an outboard
motor. All that time Florence had
held the hose in her hand. Once again Katie
gave the rope a vicious jerk. And then! Was
it like an outboard motor? Like ten outboard
motors all in one the thing thundered&mdash;the
hose in Florence&rsquo;s hand writhed and twisted
like a snake. It swung half around her neck,
tripped a boy passing down the line, stiffened
like a bent and twisted gas pipe, then shot
forth a stream that would have gone forty
feet if it had not encountered an obstacle.
That obstacle was Mike&rsquo;s broad chest!</p>
<p>Thrown off his balance by that irresistible
force, with the swiftness of light, Mike spun
half-way round, rose in air, then went plunging
into space. When space rejected him, the
glad, cold waters of the harbor opened their
arms to receive him!</p>
<p>Startled, thrown into sudden consternation
by this turn of events, Florence, without intending
it at all, swung the hose about and
the stream sent Tony plunging after his pal.</p>
<p>Then, like some creature that has done its
work swiftly and well, the pump coughed
twice, and lapsed into silence. Above this
silence there rose a low laugh. It ran all down
the line of boys and all the way back again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Taking advantage of the situation, Florence
exclaimed, &ldquo;Boys, we have pumps. You all
have homes. If they were in danger, you&rsquo;d
save them if you could. You&rsquo;ve got to help
save this home now! Get those boxes open.
Quick. Fill the tanks. Turn &rsquo;em over. If half
the pumps work, we&rsquo;ll win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catching the spirit of the moment thirty
boys leaped into action. In the shortest
imaginable time five pumps were coughing
and sneezing like five bull moose come up for
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Florence thought, with a sudden
touch of despair, &ldquo;is all right. But how shall
we reach the fire?&rdquo; Her eyes fell upon a dozen
gasoline barrels piled neatly by the dock house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Cut two holes in
the top of each barrel. Then roll four up the
ridge, each about forty feet from the next
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though they did not understand why, the
boys followed her directions. When this was
done, she said, &ldquo;Now! Two of you to a pump.
Take them up to the barrels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bu-but, Miss, we don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said
the small, timid boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s little time for explaining,&rdquo; Florence
snapped. &ldquo;But this is the idea, each pump
will throw water thirty or forty feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, yea,&rdquo; they agreed, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a hundred
and fifty to the top of that first ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; the girl explained. &ldquo;The
first pump will force the water up to the first
barrel. Then we will put the short hose of
the second pump in that barrel and draw the
water out. That second pump will carry the
water another thirty feet to the second barrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so on and on to the top,&rdquo; someone
exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand idea. Think of a girl
workin&rsquo; that out all by herself! Come on.
Let&rsquo;s get goin&rsquo;.&rdquo; And they did.</p>
<p>It was with a feeling of deep satisfaction
that Florence saw this first task well begun.
This first ridge, with its sparse growth of fir
and balsam, could be well soaked down before
the fire arrived. The battle was not won,
but a good beginning had been made and
Florence, as she studied the youthful faces
about her, knew that her little army would
stick to the last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are chickens on board,&rdquo; she said so
they could all hear. &ldquo;Twelve large, fat chickens
in the boat&rsquo;s refrigerator. They were
meant for a Lodge. We&rsquo;ll roast them all over
the coals of this fire when the battle is won.&rdquo;
A low, hoarse cheer greeted these remarks.
Then, at a word, five sturdy young pumps,
each with the power of ten outboard motors,
began passing water from barrel to barrel
until it shot forth in a broad stream.</p>
<p>Fired with new hope, boys not needed at the
pumps seized axes and began slashing at the
taller trees and dragging them away. When
at last the fire, fanned by a fresh breeze, came
sweeping down the highest ridge into the narrow
run, then started climbing the &ldquo;last desperate
hope,&rdquo; that lower ridge, a thin line of
grim-faced, determined boys met it half-way.
Such was the influence of one girl who refused
to give up!</p>
<p>With all the pumps manned by the lightweight
boys, the powerful Katie and Florence
seized axes and rushed down to add their bit.
It was then that a flaming spruce tree, toppling
to a fall, pinned a smoke-blackened boy
beneath its branches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Katie! Quick!&rdquo; Florence screamed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
be burned to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With power born of desperation, the girls
wrenched away flaming branches, then
dragged the boy clear. His shirt was on fire.
Florence tore the garment from him and
stamped it into the damp moss. Then half
dragging, half carrying the injured lad, she
removed him to safety.</p>
<p>It was only after the danger was over that
she recognized the youth she had saved. She
truly did receive a shock!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mike! It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d y&rsquo; think it was goin&rsquo; to be?&rdquo; growled
Mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mike! You helping to fight the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t helpin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Mike lied. &ldquo;I was just
dryin&rsquo; out me clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Florence turned over his right hand.
It was still red from the work it had done.
There were two fresh blisters there. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
she said, speaking with difficulty, &ldquo;you&mdash;you
were drying your clothes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>For a moment there was silence, save for
the roar and crackle of the fire blazing away
where it could do no harm. As the girl
watched the flames dart high, only to fall back
against water-soaked trees, she knew she was
safe in snatching a few moments of rest. The
victory was won. The little fishery, the tiny
cabins, the humble home of her friends&mdash;all
were safe. The fire would creep along the
ridge until it came to barren rocks and the
waters of Superior. There it would flash and
sputter its life away. There might be other
fires on the island. There were. She caught
the light of them in the distance. But Chippewa
Harbor was safe!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t fer you that I done it!&rdquo; Mike
protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think yer smart, don&rsquo;t y&rsquo;?&rdquo; was Mike&rsquo;s
only reply.</p>
<p>The truth was, Florence had unlocked the
only door to Mike&rsquo;s heart. With the aid of that
sputtering pump, she had licked him good and
plenty. And the law of physical force was the
only law Mike knew anything about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mike,&rdquo; said Florence after a time, &ldquo;what
do you know about these fires being set?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; said Mike. &ldquo;Say! You don&rsquo;t
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; She stopped him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
anything like that. But I must find out, right
away. Here, shake on it.&rdquo; Her good, stout,
capable hand gripped Mike&rsquo;s blisters, but
Mike never flinched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />RIDING THE STORM</h2>
<p>True to their promise, when the <i>Wanderer</i>
returned, Florence and Katie prepared a
grand feast of roast chicken, hot biscuits and
coffee for the weary young fire-fighters. None
enjoyed this more than did Mike and Tony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the next war comes,&rdquo; Tony laughed,
&ldquo;you join up as Captain and we&rsquo;ll be your
privates!&rdquo; Coming from Tony this was high
praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing sure,&rdquo; Dave said, after the feast
was over, &ldquo;if you ever again need help from
those boys you&rsquo;ll get it without a murmur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chickens come high!&rdquo; was Florence&rsquo;s
strange reply. &ldquo;But I guess it&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Yes, chicken did come high. All those
dressed birds must be replaced, and the little
company&rsquo;s purse was very flat. There was a
worried note in Dave&rsquo;s voice as he said, &ldquo;Tomorrow
we must return to the mainland for
fuel oil. I wonder if we get it? The last bill
isn&rsquo;t paid yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That worry was still with them as, after
unloading the fishermen&rsquo;s goods, they headed
away across the glassy waters of Superior.
But when Father Superior is in a happy mood,
who can worry? &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; Florence thought,
&ldquo;was the water so smooth or the sky so blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Indian John at the wheel and Katie&rsquo;s
galley sending out delicious odors, the three
of them, Dave, Florence and Jeanne, sat on
deck looking dreamily off across the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a phantom fisherman off the end
of Edward&rsquo;s Island,&rdquo; Jeanne murmured, half
talking to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fisherman, but no phantom,&rdquo; Dave insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our privilege in this life,&rdquo; said Jeanne,
&ldquo;to have what we want, provided we tread on
no one&rsquo;s toes. I want a phantom fisherman,
so I shall have one. You want a real fisherman.
You may have him, too. Neither of us
wishes any fish, so what does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Dave agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is important,&rdquo; Florence insisted.
&ldquo;Are those fires on the island being set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been told they were,&rdquo; insisted his
cousin. &ldquo;Twice I&rsquo;ve heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the queer part.&rdquo;
She went on to tell of the strange voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably some ignorant fisherman talking
nonsense,&rdquo; was Dave&rsquo;s verdict. &ldquo;They cling to
these crags trying to eke out a living until
they get a little cracked in the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this, Florence would not agree. She had
heard the voice. She had seen the mysterious
youth and was sure she would see him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Questions that interest me more are&mdash;shall
we be allowed to continue carrying passengers?&rdquo;
said Dave, &ldquo;and can we get more fuel
oil on credit? Upon these answers depends
our future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps the future of the island,&rdquo;
Florence added soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, even that,&rdquo; Dave admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dave laughed as, late that day, his
boat tied up at Houghton, he slowly paced the
dock, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t have to worry about the future
for a day or two. This nor&rsquo;wester will
keep us in port, come what will.&rdquo; Just as they
entered the canal, ten miles from Houghton,
a wild storm had come booming in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we make a trip if we had to?&rdquo;
Florence asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we had to, I suppose we could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that,&rdquo; a brusque
voice interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Dave stared. He found himself
looking into the keen, gray eyes of the elderly
man whom with his granddaughter, they had
rescued some days before from Greenstone
Ridge on Isle Royale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are having a hard time on the island,&rdquo;
the man explained. &ldquo;Chips wants more pumps
and hose. There are pumps here&mdash;twenty of
them&mdash;and ten thousand feet of hose. I&rsquo;d
like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo; Dave broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see how that affects me,&rdquo; the
man laughed. &ldquo;I happen to be an assistant
national park commissioner; so this is my job.
I am Colonel Colby.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-o,&rdquo; Dave breathed, &ldquo;and you want us
to make a trip to Isle Royale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is imperative. The pumps must go. The
<i>Iroquois</i> is in port, but she is old and clumsy.
She&rsquo;d not be safe, but your boat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d do all right, but&mdash;&rdquo; Dave hesitated,
&ldquo;our passenger license expires tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passenger license!&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s voice
rose. &ldquo;Who said anything about passengers?
Of course,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I shall go with you,
but&mdash;I,&rdquo; he hesitated. &ldquo;Well, you may ship
me as freight,&rdquo; he laughed heartily. &ldquo;Anyway,
I represent the Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Bring on your pumps. We&rsquo;ll run
down for fresh fuel. Be back here in half an
hour,&rdquo; was the young skipper&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more,&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;I hate to
tell you this. You may think we&rsquo;re whining,
but I doubt if our credit for fuel is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to that also,&rdquo; the colonel replied
without a second&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K. We&rsquo;ll be with you in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; The colonel gripped
Dave&rsquo;s hand for an instant, then was away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>When two hours later the <i>Wanderer</i> nosed
her way out of the smooth water of the canal
into the surging seas that swept Lake Superior,
Dave caught his breath. Had he, for
once, overestimated the cruising power of his
stout little craft? Only time would tell. The
<i>Wanderer</i> appeared to glory in its battle with
the waters. Climbing one monstrous wave, it
glided down the breaker&rsquo;s slope, only to start
climbing again. Great splashes of white spray
were dashed against the pilothouse window.
The deck was all awash; yet the <i>Wanderer&rsquo;s</i>
motors throbbed sweetly as the gallant boat
forged its way ahead.</p>
<p>Night came. The storm increased. The
black waves of night seemed more terrible than
those of the day. Struggling into her little
galley, Katie braced herself stiff-legged
against a screwed-down table while she prepared
sandwiches for the weary men.</p>
<p>Below deck, one of the twenty pumps, breaking
its moorings, threatened to smash the
others into bits. Only after many bumps and
bruises was Rufus able to restore it to its
proper place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wi-wild night,&rdquo; Dave&rsquo;s words were blown
down his throat as he reached gratefully for
his sandwich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tho-thought I saw a light,&rdquo; Florence
screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Sure! There it is!&rdquo; Dave shouted.
&ldquo;Must be Passage Island. And boy, oh, boy!
If it is, we&rsquo;re right on our course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were on their course. They had Indian
John to thank for that. One peril still lay
before them&mdash;the narrow, rocky entrance of
Rock Harbor. Could they make it? There was
a prayer in every heart as they neared the dark
bulks looming out of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little islands that guard the channel,&rdquo;
Dave explained, playing his ship&rsquo;s light upon
them. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all solid rock. And you don&rsquo;t
see all of them. Some are just under the water.
One touch on a night like this, and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There&rsquo;s the gap!&rdquo; he exclaimed
excitedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s straight ahead of us, one
marker to the right and one to the left. Thank
God, the waves are striking the island squarely!
We&rsquo;ll ride them like a bucking broncho.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he breathed, as a huge breaker bore
them forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed, as a second,
larger than the first, broke with a hiss under
the <i>Wanderer&rsquo;s</i> prow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now!&rdquo; shouted the gray-haired
colonel, as the stout little craft glided off the
last wave to the calm of Rock Harbor. &ldquo;That&mdash;that
was marvelous!&rdquo; He gripped Florence
and Dave by the hands. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
missed it for the world. And now,&rdquo; he added
quietly, &ldquo;now for Chips. He&rsquo;ll be waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chips was waiting, and it was the privilege
of the young navigators to witness his marvelous
efficiency. With the smoothness of
clockwork, his men marched aboard the boat,
thrust rope-lashed poles beneath each pump,
then disappeared into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll lick the fire,&rdquo; Chips murmured.
&ldquo;Besides, the wind&rsquo;s shifting, and there&rsquo;s the
smell of rain in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are good beds down at the lodge at
the other end of the harbor,&rdquo; the gray-haired
colonel turned to the <i>Wanderer&rsquo;s</i> crew. &ldquo;You
all need some real rest. It&rsquo;s smooth going all
the way. What do you say we go down and
tie up there for twenty-four hours?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; exclaimed Florence, &ldquo;would be
keen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so say we all,&rdquo; Dave echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;John, you know this
channel. Suppose you take the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir!&rdquo; Indian John saluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, how about a few words over a
cup of coffee?&rdquo; suggested the colonel.</p>
<p>It was a very friendly chat they had with
the colonel, as, with the light of the moon
streaming in at their window, they sat contentedly
listening to the distant roar of dashing
waves.</p>
<p>Without seeming to pry into their affairs,
the gray-haired man found out just how matters
stood with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been doing a grand work,&rdquo; he rumbled
at last. &ldquo;In a most splendid spirit. Before
I left I told Addison, the fuel man you
know, to supply all your needs. I shall stand
back of you in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&mdash;that&rsquo;s grand!&rdquo; Florence choked
a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how we can thank you, sir!&rdquo;
Dave said huskily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to. This is perhaps but the
beginning. I hope we have much better things
in store for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little we have done has been for the
good of the kindly people of the island,&rdquo; said
Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for the good of all,&rdquo; added the colonel.
&ldquo;You must not forget that Isle Royale is to
be a national park. That it is to belong to all
the people of America. When you save a
square mile of that virgin beauty you are saving
it for all the American people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
&ldquo;That man with the speed boat doesn&rsquo;t
like you very well, does he? I suppose you
know the reason why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was Florence&rsquo;s quick reply, &ldquo;we have
wondered about him ever since we brought
him to the island and he seemed ready to put
us in chains because we insisted on helping
to save the camp at Siskowit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s threatened to have our license revoked,&rdquo;
Dave put in. &ldquo;It all seems a bit fantastic.
We really never did anything to him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, probably not,&rdquo; the colonel agreed.
&ldquo;But your grandfather did and it is his boat
you are operating, I am told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather! Grandfather?&rdquo; they exclaimed.
&ldquo;He never wronged anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never did,&rdquo; the colonel agreed, &ldquo;but
he got in bad by doing right. This man who
has chosen you for an enemy was once running
a boat contrary to regulations, carrying
many more passengers than the law allows,
endangering people&rsquo;s lives. The authorities
asked your grandfather about it. Being the sort
of man who hates lies, he told the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for Granddad!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; the gray-haired man agreed. &ldquo;For
all that, he made himself a lifetime enemy.
But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you need not worry further
about him. I shall see that he is properly taken
care of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he exclaimed springing to the window,
&ldquo;we are at Snug Harbor&mdash;our night of
storm is over. I shall arrange at once for your
accommodations at the Lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are to have a hot bath and sleep between
clean, white sheets,&rdquo; Florence whispered
to Jeanne. &ldquo;How perfectly grand!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Scarcely had their boat touched the dock
when Katie began talking in her own tongue
to a fisherman whose small boat was tied up
to the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says,&rdquo; she exclaimed eagerly, &ldquo;that he
is going to the camp at Siskowit where mine
brother is. I do so wish to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he coming back?&rdquo; Florence asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her go,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll catch up
with us somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the happy Katie went gliding away
through the dawn with her new-found friend.
She had dinner that day with her brother and
his companions at camp. That night, fired
with enthusiasm by the talk of the boys who
had only words of praise for the <i>Wanderer</i> and
her crew, she returned to Rock Harbor in
plenty of time to take up her duties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />ASHES IN THEIR HAIR</h2>
<p>To our good pals, Florence and Jeanne,
who had been so tossed about by the
waves of old Superior in his worst mood,
nothing could have been more delightful than
the interlude that followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contrast!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed, as, after
a refreshing bath, she welcomed the clean
coolness of linen sheets. &ldquo;It is contrast that
makes living such a joy. Half the night we
tumble about in the dark, the other half we
rest in the most perfect of summer lodges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne agreed. &ldquo;Tomorrow we
dream by an open fire. And next day&mdash;who
knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who indeed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>They slept until ten next morning. Because
of their service to the island all dining room
rules were broken, and they were served with
delicious French toast and coffee. After that,
they retired to the broad lounge where they
stretched themselves out in roomy chairs before
a cheerful fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How grand it would be just to live here
as guests!&rdquo; Jeanne whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And forget all about the fire,&rdquo; Florence
agreed. &ldquo;But that would be impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed it would. The fires were not
forgotten by anyone. Only the hardiest of
souls had remained on the island. At that moment,
catching snatches of conversation from
the guests lounging in the big room, the girls
heard, &ldquo;They say they&rsquo;re being set; these
fires.&rdquo; It was a woman who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; Florence whispered. &ldquo;What have I
been saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s voice rumbled.
&ldquo;The island is like tinder. Bits of birchbark
are lighted by the flames. They break away
and are carried miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still on fire?&rdquo; said another voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; the man insisted. &ldquo;There are
ashes in your hair right now, and you weren&rsquo;t
out of doors a quarter-hour. Where did they
come from? Many miles away. Yesterday I
saw a black object floating down. I caught it.
It was a leaf, charred black by the fire. It had
floated in the air miles and miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently convinced, his companions said
no more. But Florence was not satisfied. Had
she not been told the fires were being set?
And had she not seen the youth with the crimson
sweater? Did some imp whisper, &ldquo;Yes,
and you are to see him again&mdash;very soon. No
good will come of that, either.&rdquo; Well, perhaps
not. Who can say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s grand fishing here at the island,&rdquo;
said a man in high boots and red plaid shirt.
&ldquo;I row a heavy boat three hundred miles every
summer, trolling for lake trout. It reduces
my waistline two inches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am always going to row a heavy boat
three hundred miles,&rdquo; drawled a large, fat
man, &ldquo;next year!&rdquo; Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last year,&rdquo; said the ardent fisherman, &ldquo;I
lost my metal lure. Wasn&rsquo;t tied right. A fish
carried it off, but he gave it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gave it back? How come?&rdquo; asked his fat
friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems he didn&rsquo;t want it, so he hung it on a
fisherman&rsquo;s net and the fisherman gave it to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You expect us to believe that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the lure to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; Florence whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
fishing first chance I get. A fellow has a little
fun coming to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne admitted, &ldquo;you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the long, lazy day passed. It was glorious
to sit in the sun, to climb over the rocks,
to loaf by the fire without a care.</p>
<p>When the next day dawned&mdash; Sh! That
was to be quite another matter.</p>
<p>Their day of perfect peace was climaxed by
a pleasant surprise just before sundown. The
evening meal was over. They had settled
themselves before the fire, when someone burst
into the room with a low exclamation, &ldquo;Moose!
Over at the salt lick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a signal for a silent exit and a
tiptoe march out around the stockade at the
back of the lodge, across the tennis court, then
into the brush to a spot where salt had been
placed to lure the wild moose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A monster!&rdquo; someone whispered, as they
came in sight of the salt lick. And he was just
that. With wide spreading antlers and bulging
eyes, in that dim light he appeared like
a very dangerous creature. Jeanne shuddered
at the sight of him. And well she might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No cause to be afraid,&rdquo; said the Commodore.
&ldquo;This is a game preserve. No one is
allowed to shoot them. They are as tame as
cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost!&rdquo; came from someone in the rear.
Who had spoken? Later, when they tried, no
one could recall.</p>
<p>The moose did seem tame enough. There
was a camera enthusiast in the group. Slipping
up close, he took time exposures. Then,
growing bolder, he touched off a flash bulb.
The moose looked up, glared about him, then
once more began licking the salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo; someone whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost!&rdquo; came as a sort of echo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>And then peace ended. Something stirred
at Jeanne&rsquo;s feet. It was Plumdum. Jeanne
gasped. She had left him curled up asleep by
the fire. Somehow, he had got out. The dog
scented the moose. The moose saw the dog.
To a moose, a dog is a wolf. To a dog, moose
spells danger.</p>
<p>Plumdum was courageous. Barking wildly,
he leaped straight at the moose. Lowering
his head and letting out a terrifying bellow,
the moose charged the dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plumdum! You&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo; Poor Jeanne
shrieked.</p>
<p>The visitors vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; Florence seized Jeanne by the
arm, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything about that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo; the little French girl
screamed.</p>
<p>Slowly, as the moose came on, Florence led
her companion back. It did seem as though
Plumdum would be killed. Yet, quick as a
flash, he avoided every toss of those massive
antlers.</p>
<p>Then came a touch of comedy. A stout
clothesline was stretched three times across
the monster&rsquo;s path. Heaving his antlers high
for one more try at Plumdum, he brought
them squarely into these lines. At once he
was entangled. Florence laughed at his frantic
efforts to break loose. But Jeanne, dashing
forward, seized the small dog to carry him
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>She was not an instant too soon. The moose,
having torn the line from its hooks, gave vent
to one more bellow of rage, and was after
them. Before them was a high board fence,
and in the fence a swinging gate. Pushing her
companion before her, Florence crowded
through the gate. The moose, only a step
behind them, thrust his nose into the opening
just as the gate slammed shut. A chain, hung
with two heavy rocks, held it tight. Florence
added her weight to that of the stones by
dropping on the chain, and Mr. Moose had
his nose pinched in a manner he would not
soon forget.</p>
<p>When at last he had freed himself, he went
swiftly and silently away into the brush. The
fight was over. Peace again reigned in Snug
Harbor. Jeanne and Florence enjoyed one
more night of repose. And tomorrow was
another day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />THE CRIMSON SPOT</h2>
<p>The next morning Florence lay dreaming
luxuriously in bed. Without knowing
why, she thought of smiling Tim O&rsquo;Hara
and his Adventurers&rsquo; Club of the air. On her
last trip to the mainland she had found a
letter from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The radio program is going big,&rdquo; he wrote.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand spot, coast to coast. We are looking
forward to your coming. As soon as the
battle of Isle Royale is over, wire me, collect,
and I&rsquo;ll get off a round trip ticket for you
that every hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To speak over the radio,&rdquo; she thought, as
she thrilled at the prospect, &ldquo;a chain broadcast,
coast to coast! What would that be
like?&rdquo; She had not the slightest idea, but hers
was the right to dream. And dream she did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Jeanne, who had risen at dawn to watch
the matchless sunrise from over the dark waters
of Superior, suddenly burst into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my dear!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
slacks and hiking boots today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; Florence asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s to be a mountain climbing. It&rsquo;s
Mt. Franklin, only five hundred feet high, but
you can see the fire from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth doing, if we have no more serious
business,&rdquo; Florence agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed. &ldquo;Your gray-haired
friend is back. He says there&rsquo;s good
news for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news?&rdquo; The big girl&rsquo;s heart leaped.
She was in her clothes and out of doors before
Jeanne could catch her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come inside and have your morning coffee,&rdquo;
Colonel Colby invited, after greetings
had been exchanged. &ldquo;Dave has gone in. I
have something to say to you both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was tantalizingly slow in coming to the
point, but after he had talked of moose,
salmon, trout, Snug Harbor and big timber,
and after the morning coffee was over, clearing
his throat, he satisfied their curiosity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have been in touch with my Department
by short wave radio. We are obliged to revise
our plans&mdash;&rdquo; Pausing, he looked at his young
companions, then went on, slowly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I truly hate doing this. I think it would
be splendid training for your young souls if
you were allowed to return home for a month
or two hence with empty pockets, but fired by
the realization that you have made a real contribution
to the happiness of your fellow men,
as you surely have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he cleared his throat again,
&ldquo;there is your grandfather&rsquo;s interest to be considered.
He is a splendid man. I know him
well. He can ill afford to lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s still more important,&rdquo; he paused
for a space of seconds, &ldquo;the truth is, we need
your boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; The colonel leaned forward.
&ldquo;When men are to be moved by hundreds, a
large craft like the <i>Iroquois</i> is best. But when
we have won this major battle with the fire,
which we hope to do in a few days&mdash;two
weeks, at most&mdash;there will remain weeks of
mopping up to be done. Men will be scattered
here and there all over the island, putting out
spot fires, cutting down charred trees, digging
out burning peat bogs. They must have food
and other supplies. Their officers must be
moved from place to place. For such a task
the <i>Wanderer</i>, that can turn around on its own
shadow and can enter every little cove with
safety, is just the craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So-o,&rdquo; he added, as his listeners waited in
breathless suspense, &ldquo;in the name of our Government
I am going to requisition your boat
for perhaps eight weeks. The pay shall be
four hundred and twenty-five dollars per week,
and you shall be supplied fuel and oil without
cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter has been gone into quite carefully,&rdquo;
the colonel held up a hand for silence.
&ldquo;We have decided that this will be a fair
settlement. And you,&rdquo; he threw back his head
and laughed, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t do a thing about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do anything about it!&rdquo; Dave enthused.
&ldquo;Four hundred and twenty-five a week, for
two months. We&rsquo;ll pay off the debt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Florence let out a low &ldquo;Hurray! Boy! That
sure is a break for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the colonel counseled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say
that. It is not a matter of luck. The best
things of life do not come by chance. You
have been tried and have proven yourselves
worthy of trust. Having discovered an opportunity
to do a real service, you did it without
thought of reward. Time after time in my
long life, I have seen men who placed service
before reward led by their very attitude into
higher things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s settled then.&rdquo; He rose from
his chair. &ldquo;I doubt if we shall need the services
of the <i>Wanderer</i> today. At least you may
stand by here for further orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo; Dave rose to salute in a
soldierly fashion.</p>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s head was fairly bursting. What
wonderful good fortune! They were to carry
on this fight, to do all the good possible, to
help save the island and its people. &ldquo;And be
paid for it!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;How grand!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>It is little wonder that she should be ready
for a picnic. When Dave assured her that he,
with the help of Katie and Ruben, could take
care of any emergency that might arise, she
and Jeanne joined the hikers, who, after a
long walk, were to view the fire from the peak
of Mt. Franklin.</p>
<p>Recalling her experience on that other occasion
when she climbed the ridge, she slung the
heavy field glasses over her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May see a moose,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Or perhaps
a bear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no bears on the island,&rdquo; someone
corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll look for
some other creature.&rdquo; She knew what. Nor
was she to be disappointed.</p>
<p>Two hours later they were standing on the
crest of the ridge, looking down the length
of the island, where great clouds of smoke
were rising and drifting away across the water.
The nearest fire, Florence estimated, could
not now be three miles from the spot where
they now stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a strong wind came up&mdash;blowing this
way&mdash;&rdquo; She shuddered as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jeanne, &ldquo;that would be tragic!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>And so it would be. Back of them were
woods and water, picturesque cottages and
happy people. Before them, fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Jeanne!&rdquo; With trembling hands
Florence passed the field glasses to her companion.
&ldquo;There on the rocks close to that dark
cluster of spruce trees, right between three
fires&mdash;do you see anything there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Jeanne spoke very slowly. &ldquo;There
is a spot&mdash;a crimson spot. It moves. It is a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or perhaps a boy,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;Listen,
Jeanne,&rdquo; the big girl&rsquo;s lips were a straight
line, &ldquo;I am going to that spot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Jeanne protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Florence was serious. &ldquo;If that is the
firebug, I shall get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that trail?&rdquo; She pointed to a narrow
break in the forest. &ldquo;It leads to the head of the
harbor. I&rsquo;m going down that on the run. If
you wish you may follow me to the camp and
the dock at the end of the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall follow,&rdquo; said Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence was away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />AND MAY YOU COME BACK</h2>
<p>As, a half hour later, Florence neared the
entrance to a second trail leading to the
flaming forest, she suddenly thought of the
fire-fighter, who had been placed there to prevent
fire-fans from rushing into danger, and
her knees all but doubled under her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I ever to get past him?&rdquo; she asked
herself in sudden consternation.</p>
<p>How indeed? Well enough she knew what
these hard-boiled fighters thought of girls who,
for sentimental reasons or for the purpose of
experiencing a thrill, tried to crowd past them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I stop to argue I&rsquo;m lost,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>Then the experience of a friend in a great
city came to her and she smiled. This friend
had been hurrying to a train when a man
sprang out before her and exclaimed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your money! This is a stick-up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to catch a train,&rdquo; her friend had
panted as she went racing straight on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do something like that,&rdquo; she concluded.
And she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Where y&rsquo; think yer goin&rsquo;, sister?&rdquo;
the fire guard demanded as she ran up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to get back there,&rdquo; she puffed.
&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s awfully important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was past him and had lost herself in
the brush before he knew what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;Now to
find that boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, she discovered at once, was not going
to be easy. There was little or no trail. She
had hoped to find an even slope on which to
travel. Instead there were ridges and narrow
valleys or low, deep runs. She was obliged
to pass around the deepest of these. In doing
so she lost her sense of direction. The brush
was thick. Wild raspberry bushes tore at her.
Vines tripped her. She stepped on a great,
fallen log. It caved in and sent her sprawling.
Fallen trees blocked her path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to get through,&rdquo; she thought,
fighting doggedly on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>To make matters worse the wind shifted,
setting great masses of smoke bellowing down
upon her. Choking and coughing, eyes blinded,
she paused to consider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I going the right way?&rdquo; she asked herself
in some alarm. To this question she could
form no answer.</p>
<p>The wind changed again. The smoke was
less dense. She pushed on.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, billows of smoke once
more bore down upon her. And this time the
air seemed hot to her flushed cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dunce I was,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish, for, at that second, the
smoke appeared to rise straight in the air. And
there, not a hundred yards away, was a wall
of fire. Even as she watched, the flames, reaching
the foot of a great spruce tree, raced to
its very top with a great whoosh. A second
tree went up like a rocket, then a third.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>She did not wait for more. She turned and
ran. Over rocks and fallen trees, through
masses of thimbleberry bushes, through a
low swampy spot that sank to her tread, she
raced until, with staring eyes and wildly beating
heart, she came squarely up against one
more wall of fire.</p>
<p>All but exhausted, she sank down upon a
great, hot rock to think. What had happened?
The wind had shifted. This had brought the
fire in from a new direction. Perhaps that
boy in the crimson sweater had set fresh
fires. Perhaps she was completely surrounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trapped,&rdquo; she thought with a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must keep my head,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;There should be a way out. There must
be. There&mdash;there just has to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough at that very moment her
good friend, Captain Frey, was talking about
that very question. He was speaking to a
dozen of his boys. Among them were Mike
and Tony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;a girl dodged past
the guard and went back there where the
fire is burning its fiercest. What she wanted
I don&rsquo;t know, but from what the guard tells
me I&rsquo;d say it was this big girl, Florence. You
all know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea&mdash;yea&mdash;yea,&rdquo; they all agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say we do!&rdquo; Mike muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the realest thing on the island!&rdquo; the
Captain exclaimed. &ldquo;If we all were like her
there&rsquo;d be no more fire. I don&rsquo;t know her
reason for going in there but it&rsquo;s bound to have
been a good one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thing is,&rdquo; his tone was sober. &ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s
shifted since she went in. If she loses her
way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she will,&rdquo; Mike broke in. &ldquo;I know dat
place. It&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of you boys must go in and bring
her out,&rdquo; the captain challenged abruptly.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s it going to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and Tony, eh, Tony?&rdquo; Mike volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure t&rsquo;ing,&rdquo; Tony agreed.</p>
<p>The captain looked at them squarely.
&ldquo;Seems to me I heard that she ducked you
two,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fergit it,&rdquo; said Mike. &ldquo;We had it comin&rsquo;.
Anyway, that was a long time ago. Leave us
go after her. We&rsquo;ll bring her out, Cap&rsquo;n. Honest,
we will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we will,&rdquo; Tony seconded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>There was a strange new light in the Captain&rsquo;s
eye and a huskiness in his voice as he
said, &ldquo;All right, boys. In you go! And may
you come back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />A DESPERATE VENTURE</h2>
<p>Mike and Tony had been gone a half
hour when Jeanne came up to the small
dock next to the entrance to the trail. Plumdum
was at her heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cap-Captain Frey!&rdquo; she exclaimed as she
met the fire fighter on the trail, &ldquo;did my
friend, Flor-Florence come this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she in danger?&rdquo; Jeanne tried to read
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid she is. However, two boys
went in after her. They may find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be bad.&rdquo; He frowned. &ldquo;The
wind changed. She&rsquo;s likely to be trapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Jeanne stood first on one foot, then
on the other. Whining low, Plumdum, sensing
her troubles, brushed against her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Of a sudden a bright idea took possession
of the little French girl. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hydroplane
tied up at the dock,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the pilot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three of us that take a turn at
it,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then,&rdquo; she caught her breath.
Jeanne had flown a great deal. She loved the
air as a seaman loves the sea. &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t
we circle over them? We&mdash;we might find
them a way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an idea!&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Plumdum?&rdquo; Jeanne asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him along. We might want to throw
him overboard just to let them know we&rsquo;re
interested,&rdquo; the captain chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Jeanne was shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an idea at that.&rdquo; He was hurrying
now. &ldquo;Can he wriggle out of a harness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Always!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne was thinking, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he got on his
mind now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain said no more. A moment later
opportunity for talk was gone, the motor was
roaring. They were away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Racing down the bay they rose in the air,
circled over the tree tops, circled once again,
then shot away above the smoke-whitened
island.</p>
<p>Had it not been for the fear in Jeanne&rsquo;s
heart regarding the safety of her good pal,
she would have enjoyed this to the full. Here
they passed over the glorious blue of the bay
and there the dark green of island forest. Here
all was blotted out by billowing white clouds
and there was dense black smoke, edged by
flames that appeared to reach for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrible to fall into a burning forest
from the air,&rdquo; she thought with a shudder.</p>
<p>Then she saw something that set her pulling
at the pilot&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she
screamed. &ldquo;There they are!&rdquo; She pointed
straight down.</p>
<p>Little room was left for doubt. In a field
of dark green a white spot stood out plainly
and beside it two dark ones. The white spot
would be Florence in slacks and a white
blouse, the other two Mike and Tony.</p>
<p>They circled low. Jeanne saw those below
wave white handkerchiefs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>Once again the plane shot upward. Three
times the pilot circled the spot. Three times
Jeanne&rsquo;s keen eyes sought for a possible way
out and three times she failed. It seemed to
her that her friends were completely encircled
by flames, that the wall of fire from the
west was closing in and that nothing could
save them. Involuntarily she pressed Plumdum
to her breast.</p>
<p>Three minutes later the plane was at rest
on the beautifully quiet bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The situation is difficult but not hopeless.&rdquo;
The Captain spoke rapidly. &ldquo;There is not a
minute to lose. There is a break in the fire
up the ridge toward the north. It&rsquo;s hidden
from them by smoke. They can&rsquo;t see it. If
we had some way to tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we land?&rdquo; Jeanne was eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a hydroplane on dry earth and rocks?&rdquo;
he stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A parachute,&rdquo; she volunteered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
baled out. Three times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No parachute,&rdquo; the captain groaned. &ldquo;If
we had one I wouldn&rsquo;t let you risk it. You&rsquo;d
get hung in a tree and be roasted to a turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There is a parachute
of a sort.&rdquo; He began digging into a
leather pocket. &ldquo;Here it is, a dog parachute.
Belongs to my dog over at camp. I&rsquo;ve dropped
him a score of times. He likes it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s your dog,&rdquo; his voice picked up.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just draw a crude map, showing
where the gap is, write a note and tie it to the
dog&rsquo;s collar. Then he&rsquo;ll make a parachute
flight. If they don&rsquo;t see him, he&rsquo;s sure to
wriggle out of the harness. We&rsquo;ll put it on
rather loosely. After he&rsquo;s free he&rsquo;ll circle and
find them. Sure to. Any dog will do that.
And he knows your big girl friend, doesn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plumdum?&rdquo; Jeanne could scarcely speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes. Oh, yes, he knows Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then is it a go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;guess&mdash; Yes. Sure it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Plumdum!&rdquo; Jeanne was thinking,
and then, &ldquo;Poor Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Ten minutes later, as the hydroplane once
again left the water to soar wide and high,
Jeanne sensed rather than felt that the wind
was picking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to hurry,&rdquo; she shrilled in the
pilot&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>The pilot nodded as he put on a sudden
burst of speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />THE DOG&rsquo;S PARACHUTE</h2>
<p>By this time you are wondering what had
happened to Florence. She had paused
to consider her own plight. She had lost all
trace of the trail, was surrounded by smoke
and flames and knew of no certain way of escape.
The only answer to such a problem was
retreat.</p>
<p>But which way? Up the ridge perhaps. She
resolved to try this. The wall of rock was all
but perpendicular. At times she was obliged
to find a toe hold in a crack between rocks,
then to grasp the root of a tree that, like herself,
clung precariously, then drag herself up.
Always there was the danger of a fall. A
broken leg might mean a terrible death by
fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>The girl was strong and steady of nerve.
No cigaret smoking, no fasting to attain a
perfect figure had sapped her strength. All
this stood her in good stead at this moment.
It saved her from possible accident. It could
not, however, change the course of the fire.
To her further consternation she discovered
as, all but exhausted, she threw herself upon
the crest, that the fire was on its way up the
opposite slope to meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh-a!&rdquo; she breathed in dismay. How
the fire roared and crackled! Already great
waves of heat were wafted up to her.</p>
<p>Turning wearily she began letting herself
back down the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not allow myself to grow desperate,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;I <i>must</i> not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forcing herself to unusual caution she held
her nerves steady and step by step made her
way down.</p>
<p>One other way of escape seemed to present
itself&mdash;a narrow, dry swamp ran between two
ridges. It was filled with smoke but there
were no flames. It might still be open. Daring
to hope, she went hurrying over its brush-entangled
bed of leaves and moss. The smoke
was stifling and all but blinding. At times
she found herself fairly groping her way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>There came a time when it seemed she could
no longer breathe. A peculiar brown smoke
appeared to rise from the very ground. This,
she discovered to her despair, was exactly
what it was doing. At this point the ground
was on fire. Isle Royale, in the beginning, was
a barren rock. All its soil is of vegetable
origin. Here in the narrow valley a form of
peat lay some three feet thick. Dry as tinder
it had ignited. To attempt to pass over it
would be to find oneself floundering in masses
of burning peat. This was unthinkable. Once
again the way was blocked.</p>
<p>Wearily she turned back to retrace her steps
to higher ground and clearer air. Scarcely
had she reached her starting point when, to
her great surprise, she heard her name called.
A great wave of joy swept over her as she
answered, &ldquo;Here! Here I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Call answered call until at last Mike and
Tony burst into view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! It&mdash;it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s us,&rdquo; Mike agreed. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d you
t&rsquo;ink? We may be tough, miss, but we know
real coin when we see it. You come from right
down our alley. Come on, we&rsquo;ll git y&rsquo; out a&rsquo;
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; a voice might have whispered.
The boys had been too intent on getting
over the trail to note that a wall of fire
was at that very moment fast closing the trail.
They had retraced their steps only a matter
of two hundred yards when they found themselves
face to face with that wall of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right fer you,&rdquo; Mike shouted defiance
at the flames. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find a way out. Never
doubt that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long before even Mike did doubt
this. Florence had warned him of danger in
two directions. All others seemed blocked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>This was the state of affairs when Jeanne
and the captain flew over them for the first
time. At sight of the plane Florence took
courage. She was sure they would try to help.
But how? They could not land. There was
no lake in the fire-encircled area. What could
they do? She was to know.</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime, on a very high point of
Greenstone Ridge, perhaps a mile away, there
stood a solitary figure. He wore a crimson
sweater and carried a high-powered glass at
his side. Three times he lifted the glass to
study the spot where Florence and the two
boys stood. At last he turned and took three
steps in their direction. Then he stopped. A
sound had reached his ears, the drum of an
airplane motor.</p>
<p>He did not go on, but, as the airplane circled
toward him, dropped from sight behind
some low-growing fir trees. Who was he?
Why was he here? Did he know a safe way
back to the spot where Florence and the boys
stood? Who could answer these questions?</p>
<p>Florence and her companions, too, heard
that motor. It was the plane&rsquo;s second trip.
Their hopes rose. They might receive aid.
But how?</p>
<p>Twice, as they stood watching, the plane
circled. Then a spot of white appeared at the
side of the plane. In the rear seat a slim figure
stood erect. It was Jeanne. She was saying,
&ldquo;Poor Plumdum.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>The spot of white detached itself from the
plane. The girl sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A parachute!&rdquo; Florence murmured hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t big enough,&rdquo; said Mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something dark&mdash;&rdquo; Florence did
not finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah! Gone into a cloud of smoke,&rdquo;
Tony groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s a message or something. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
get it. I&rsquo;ve got the direction. You stay right
here,&rdquo; Florence was away.</p>
<p>Dashing through brush, over fallen trees
and around giant boulders she had covered
half the distance when to her vast astonishment
she began hearing strange sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; she asked herself. She
stopped dead in her tracks.</p>
<p>What indeed? Now it was like the ki-yi of
a badly frightened dog and now like the roar
of a mad bull.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>As she stood there the sounds grew louder
until the whole air seemed filled with them.
Then, to her utter consternation she saw poor
little Plumdum racing toward her. And after
him, tongue lolling, massive antlers tossing,
came a giant bull moose.</p>
<p>For ten seconds, her whole body paralyzed
with fear, she stood there motionless. Then
her alert mind began to work. Full well she
knew the hatred every moose bears for every
creature of the dog and wolf family.</p>
<p>To stand there and gather the small dog
in her arms would have been a gallant but
fatal gesture. She would have been torn in
pieces.</p>
<p>She did not pause but fled down the way
she had come. Realizing that the moose was
much faster than herself, she began dodging
to the right here and the left there. The
moose, she knew, had poor eyesight. She was
putting low-growing spruce trees between
herself and her pursuer. This gave her added
time. Twice the moose, coming head on into
the sturdy limbs of a tree, was obliged to back
away before continuing the chase.</p>
<p>Plumdum had dodged off into the brush.
Mike and Tony, hearing the roar of the moose
had climbed trees. It was Florence and the
moose for it. Or was it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>She had gained considerable distance, had
raced past the spot she had left without seeing
the boys in the trees and was hoping to
elude her pursuer when catastrophy befell her.
Her boot caught in a vine and sent her sprawling.
Worst of all, she fell on a half rotten
stump which knocked the breath out of her.
In agony she tried to rise. It was impossible.</p>
<p>Tony was slim, agile as a cat, a typical
Italian. His dark eyes had taken it all in.
His trigger-like mind had formed a plan. The
moose would pass beneath his tree. And
then&mdash;</p>
<p>Something hit the moose squarely in the
back. Something seized his antlers in a grip
of steel. Thrown into sudden panic, he forgot
Florence to go bolting down the slope toward
the swamp where the ground was on fire.</p>
<p>Neither Mike nor Florence saw this last bit
of wildwoods drama. They were astonished
when Tony did not at once answer their call.
But here was Plumdum whimpering at their
feet. And there, safely tied to his collar was a
precious message.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />WHO RIDES A MOOSE</h2>
<p>The small hydroplane was back at the
dock. The captain had said, &ldquo;We have
done what we could. We can only hope for
the best.&rdquo; A picture of woe, Jeanne sat on
the narrow dock. In an effort to save a good
pal she had sacrificed her beloved Plumdum.
She did not regret the sacrifice if only it saved
her friend. But would it?</p>
<p>At times she felt an all but overpowering
desire to dash away over the trail in the vain
hope of passing the fiery barrier. Twice she
rose to carry out the mad plan. Twice she
resumed her seat on the dock.</p>
<p>When she rose for the third time the captain
said, &ldquo;Come on. Hop in. We&rsquo;ll fly over
and see what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>They did fly. And they did see. Jeanne had
marked the spot where Florence had stood.
It was between three great rocks. Already the
fire had come that far. Three times they circled.
No trace of their lost comrades did they
find. What had happened? Would they ever
know? Jeanne sank back into her seat.</p>
<p class="tb">She did not remain so for long. Of a sudden
she sat up to clutch the pilot and to
scream in his ear, &ldquo;Captain Frey please circle
back over that bare knob of rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; The captain turned the wheel.</p>
<p>A crimson spot on that bare flat rock had
caught Jeanne&rsquo;s attention. This, she reasoned
must be the boy in the crimson sweater. He
it had been that had lured her good friend
Florence into the fire trap. Well, he should
pay for that. He should have a warning this
very moment. Deftly forming a bit of string
and her handkerchief into a tiny parachute,
she attached a bit of greenstone rock to it,
then clutched it between her knees while she
scribbled a note. This note read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You are suspected of setting these
fires. If you are guilty you shall be
caught. We are on your trail. <i>Gypsies
never forget.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Binding this note to the greenstone rock
she waited. The plane soared lower and lower.
They would pass over the rock at a hundred
feet. Accustomed to judge the speed of planes,
she leaned far over and waited. Then, as she
found herself all but looking into the eyes of
the mysterious youth, she allowed the tiny
parachute to go drifting away.</p>
<p>Watching, she saw the white spot dropping
lower and lower. &ldquo;Good! He sees it!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo; Then she whispered
low, &ldquo;The gypsies&rsquo; first warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">It was with trembling fingers that Florence
unbound the pocket on Plumdum&rsquo;s collar. Together
she and Mike studied the crude map
which Captain Frey had drawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; the girl murmured. &ldquo;That gap
between fires must be in that direction.&rdquo; She
pointed toward a low ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mike corrected. &ldquo;This way more.&rdquo;
He was looking at his compass. &ldquo;We better
scram. Dat note says no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Tony? What about him?&rdquo; the girl
protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tony,&rdquo; the boy&rsquo;s brow wrinkled. Well
enough Florence knew the bond of undying
friendship between these two boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tony.&rdquo; There was a forced note of
cheerfulness in Mike&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s a Dago.
He&rsquo;s made out of tin cans, old asbestos an&rsquo;
other scrap. He wouldn&rsquo;t burn.&rdquo; The laugh
that followed was far from real.</p>
<p>Florence was touched. She swallowed a
tear, swayed a little, then said simply,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al-all right, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; And what else was
there to do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let out a yell now and then,&rdquo; said
Mike.</p>
<p>Gathering Plumdum into her ample arms,
Florence led the way.</p>
<p>Their way ran across the dried-up bog. The
ground was soft. For some distance their
footprints remained plainly marked. At last
these prints were lost on the rocky slopes
beyond.</p>
<p>Now and again Mike paused to shout, &ldquo;Yo-ho!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Only the ridge echoed back faintly, &ldquo;Yo-ho!&rdquo;
and yet more faintly, &ldquo;Yo-ho!&rdquo; Mike&rsquo;s
feet seemed to drag but he kept doggedly on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I stay behind,&rdquo; he was thinking, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll
stay too. An&rsquo; that won&rsquo;t do. She&rsquo;s worth the
two of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came at last to a spot where, near the
crest of the ridge, they were between two fires.
The heat here was intense, almost scorching.
Plumdum whined piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Florence urged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mike moaned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me pal,
Tony. I&mdash;I gotta go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Florence hissed, seizing his
arm. &ldquo;Not now. You&rsquo;re going on if I have to
drag you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; Mike replied
miserably.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later they were past all danger.
On the crest of a higher ridge, where
there were no trees, only rock, and where a
cool breeze fanned their parched cheeks, they
watched the fire roaring on beneath them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ton-Tony!&rdquo; A veritable roar of anguish
escaped Mike&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>To their unbounded astonishment there
came an answer, &ldquo;Here! Here I am! What
you t&rsquo;ink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; Mike broke into a roar of
laughter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tony. My Tony. Didn&rsquo;t I tell
you? You can&rsquo;t burn up a Dago like him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unashamed the two boys embraced each
other. A moment later, with Plumdum yip-yipping
his delight at their heels, the three
of them danced a jig atop a great, flat rock.</p>
<p>Once more Mike went into the lead by declaring,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better scram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And scram they did. Following the ridge
until they were well beyond the fire line, they
came at last upon an ancient trail leading
down. Turning they went racing down this
trail at a speed that must have spelled
disaster to a less hardy trio.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later they burst out upon
the shores of silent waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Rock Harbor,&rdquo; Florence breathed,
almost as a prayer of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>On the dock at the head of that same harbor
a half hour later Jeanne sat in the depths
of despair. Florence was gone. Plumdum was
gone. What could she do?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Of a sudden, from the distance she caught
a familiar sound, the shrill barking of a small
dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plumdum!&rdquo; she exclaimed springing to her
feet. &ldquo;It must be. There is no other such dog
on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a wild looking Jeanne who burst
through the brush to greet her lost friends a
short time later. Her dress was torn, her hair
was flying wild, but her eyes shone with a
glorious light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plumdum! Florence!&rdquo; she screamed, gathering
the dog in her arms and being in turn
gathered in by Florence.</p>
<p>It was only over a rich &ldquo;Mulligan&rdquo; stew
prepared by Captain Frey&rsquo;s cook that Tony&rsquo;s
story was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you go down,&rdquo; he said to Florence.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; heard yer breath go out. I thought, &lsquo;That
moose will get her fer sure.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he would have,&rdquo; Captain Frey
agreed. &ldquo;A moose has hoofs that are like
steel chisels.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So-o,&rdquo; Tony breathed, continuing his story,
&ldquo;I dropped on his back. Swell luck. I grabbed
his antlers. Then I ducked down to miss the
branches. And say-ee!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Talk
about speed! He was worse&rsquo;n an airplane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo; he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what, ye dummie?&rdquo; Mike demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t nice. I hate t&rsquo; tell ye.&rdquo; Tony took
in a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he go toward the dry swamp?&rdquo; Florence
asked. Tony nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I know,&rdquo; the girl said with a shudder,
&ldquo;the moose went into the peat bog that&rsquo;s
on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; stuck there fer a minute.&rdquo; Tony
agreed. &ldquo;I swing off on a low limb of a tree.
Then I scram. Of course, I don&rsquo;t know but
I kin guess what come of Mr. Moose.&rdquo; He
heaved a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Tony,&rdquo; Florence said after a moment,
&ldquo;how did you know which way the gap in the
fire wall was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found yer tracks crossin&rsquo; t&rsquo; dry swamp,&rdquo;
said Tony with a grin. &ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;
straight,&rsquo; I says to meself. &lsquo;That means they
know which way t&rsquo; go.&rsquo; And you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; Florence put in warmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was great!&rdquo; Captain Frey exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind has changed,&rdquo; the captain announced
a short time later. &ldquo;That means Rock Harbor
shores don&rsquo;t burn, not just yet. We may get
a little rain tonight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better stay with us,&rdquo; he added, turning
to the girls. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll run you down to the
lodge first thing in the morning. There&rsquo;s a
snug cabin which Mrs. Frey occupies when
she is here. You will have it all to yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was agreed. And Florence was not
sorry. Surely she had seen quite enough of
life for one day. Sleep would be sweet after
such wild adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of the boy in the crimson sweater?&rdquo;
she asked herself dreamily as she drifted off
to sleep. Then, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him yet.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br />THE PHANTOM OF SUPERIOR</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;do you remember
that man over at Rock Harbor lodge
who was always talking about fishing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got me all excited. Let&rsquo;s celebrate
our wonderful luck getting that Government
contract by going fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne murmured, &ldquo;I only wish to sit
on the rocks and dream the hours away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the next day. Several hours were at
their disposal. They were anchored at Tobin&rsquo;s
Harbor. The <i>Iroquois</i> was due at sunset with
a boat-load of supplies for fire-fighters. The
<i>Wanderer</i> was to help distribute these, so for
the time they were standing by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would desert me?&rdquo; said Florence with
a laugh. &ldquo;Katie will go. Won&rsquo;t you, Katie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fishing?&rdquo; Katie&rsquo;s eyes shone. &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>A half hour later the two girls were on their
way to the fishing grounds. Florence was in
her element. For her there was nothing quite
like the &ldquo;living water&rdquo; of old Superior. In a
rowboat you are so close to it. Each dark
blue wave as it lifts you, then pushes you
gently forward, seems reluctant to let you go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is <i>so</i> blue!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Must be the copper in these rocks that makes
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Katie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the blue of the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Katie agreed once again.</p>
<p>Truth is, Katie had scarcely heard. She,
too, was in her element. She was enjoying
perfect physical activity, and that, to her, was
life. L I F E, spelled with big round letters.
With a rhythmic motion, keeping pace with
the waves, her strong arms moved slowly
back and forth while the oars flashed in the
sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she repeated as if something more
had been said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Stop!&rdquo; Florence cried. Her line
had been given a sudden pull.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A fish,&rdquo; said Katie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big one!&rdquo; Florence enthused, reeling in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so big,&rdquo; said Katie.</p>
<p>Katie was right. It was not so big, perhaps
three pounds. A fine fish for all that and
Florence thrilled at landing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she thought, as they rounded a
rocky point to cut across a gap to a small
rocky island beyond, &ldquo;there must be a fifteen
pounder somewhere, just must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Katie as if reading her thoughts.</p>
<p>There was not for all that. No fifteen
pounder rose to their lure around the far end
of Edward&rsquo;s Island. Six times they worked
their way along the point, crossed it and circled
back, but only one small fish brought
them a moment&rsquo;s thrill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed as once more
they headed out from the point. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that
lone fisherman, the mysterious one who is always
there. Jeanne calls him the Phantom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Katie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out at what the
fishermen call Five Foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s voice was eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One mile,&rdquo; said Katie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Lifting the field glasses to her eyes Florence
studied the lone fisherman as he glided
across the blue waters, then turned and glided
back again. There was something about the
waters on this day that seemed to lift him up
above the surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if he were floating through air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Katie, showing all her fine teeth
in a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! He&mdash;he&rsquo;s got one!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed,
quite forgetting her own line. &ldquo;Must
be a big one. How he pulls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lone fisherman was standing up in his
boat. He was pulling in a hand line, yards
and yards of it. To Florence, who waited
breathlessly, the line seemed endless. And
yet, when the end did come it was with sudden
shock, for the fish seemed immense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whopper!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;A regular
whale. Katie, we&rsquo;re going out there! We
must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be too far,&rdquo; Katie suggested half-heartedly.
She, too, was a born fisherman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; Florence argued. &ldquo;His boat
is no larger than ours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Motor boat.&rdquo; Katie suggested. For all her
protests she was not turning back. Instead
she was heading straight out over the blue-black
surface of Superior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mile,&rdquo; Florence thought with a sudden
intake of breath, &ldquo;a mile from anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of the <i>Wanderer</i> tied up there
at the dock in Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor, of Dave and
all the rest. All that seemed dreamy and far
away. What did it matter today?</p>
<p>Had she but known it, today had but begun
and what a day it was to be!</p>
<p>It was with a feeling almost of guilt that
she sat there watching the waves pass them
one by one. With an all but silent swish, each
seemed to whisper a warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hear,&rdquo; she told them defiantly.
&ldquo;Five Foot and big fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes, Five Foot. How often she had
heard fishermen speak of it. There, a mile
from anywhere, the rocks rose within five feet
of the surface. That was why it was Five
Foot. Beneath this giant submerged boulder,
a full quarter mile long, scaly monsters lurked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Was it conscience that whispered, &ldquo;Yield
not to temptation!&rdquo; Florence did not believe in
conscience, at least, not too much. So Katie
rowed on and Florence, watching a bank of
beautiful blue and black clouds roll along the
horizon, thought, &ldquo;What a grand old world
this is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon be at the spar,&rdquo; Katie broke into her
day-dreams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reef begins there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al-all right,&rdquo; Florence gripped her rod.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The Lone Fisherman
is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; Katie seemed startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; her face broadened into a smile.
&ldquo;Over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. Out some distance further,
perhaps a mile, the same small boat circled
and bobbed, bobbed and circled again.</p>
<p>It was then that Florence began to believe
in Jeanne&rsquo;s strange notion, that this Lone
Fisherman was no real fisherman at all and
his boat no real boat, but that it was a phantom
boat manned by a ghostly fisherman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More than one small craft has vanished,&rdquo;
she thought with a shudder. &ldquo;The Flying
Dutchman of Superior,&rdquo; she whispered. She
laughed at her own superstitious imagination,
but the laugh was followed by a shudder. And
at that moment the sun went under a cloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />FATHER SUPERIOR AT HIS WORST</h2>
<p>The instant the sun left them the whole
world appeared to change. The water
lay all about them black and threatening.
Land seemed miles away. Florence shook herself.
Then she glanced up at the sun. The
cloud was but a small one. Already the sun
was painting a golden rim along its lower
edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rocks,&rdquo; said Katie, &ldquo;are down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking down into the water at the side of
the boat, Florence was startled. The water
was crystal clear. The great masses of rocks
were so real that they seemed dry land. &ldquo;As
if we were floating on air above it,&rdquo; she told
herself. It was strange.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; said Katie, as, a moment
later, they passed across the far end of
that submerged reef. &ldquo;You go across fast.&rdquo;
Her stout arms sent the boat racing. &ldquo;Then
you drop your oars and let the lure sink down,
down, down. If you don&rsquo;t get a rock, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish, for at that instant something
all but dragged the pole from her companion&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Katie exclaimed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no! The line went slack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;What a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Katie exclaimed again as the pole
all but bent double. &ldquo;Hang on tight. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was there ever such a thrilling, appalling
moment? Once again the line went slack.</p>
<p>But not for long. Ten seconds and the
pull came again. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Katie exclaimed,
half rising in her place, &ldquo;Now you got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That she had something big on her line,
Florence could not doubt. That it was alive
she was not long in finding out. She had
reeled in twenty feet of line when, of a sudden,
the reel handle was jerked from her fingers.
Her knuckles were barked until they bled as
she tried in vain to recover that handle. Only
the strength of her line saved the day, the
line and Katie, for the stout young Finn began
backing the boat away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve still got him,&rdquo; Florence panted as
she took a fresh grip on her reel.</p>
<p>Once more she began reeling in. Ten, twenty,
thirty feet, the fish came grudgingly. Then,
with a suddenness that was startling, the pull
on the line redoubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s turned on you. Hold&mdash;hold on hard!&rdquo;
Katie screamed.</p>
<p>This time Florence&rsquo;s fingers did not slip.
With grim determination she held on. This
was a truly big one. She must have him. Was
he the catch of the season? What joy if only
he were. To work as she had worked, then to
play for only a day, to bring in the prize fish!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she breathed as once more the strain
lessened and she started reeling in.</p>
<p>Of a sudden the line went slack. &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;
she exclaimed in consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! He may&mdash;be only&mdash;&rdquo; Katie did
not finish. Once again the reel sang. After
a rush toward the boat the fish had darted to
the right. Once again the girl&rsquo;s reel was
emptied and it was only Katie&rsquo;s skill with the
boat that saved the line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said Florence with a mock-sober
look on her face, &ldquo;I wish we hadn&rsquo;t
hooked that fish.&rdquo; Rubbing the blood from
her knuckles, she began again.</p>
<p>For a time she met with greater success.
Nearly all her line was in. The fish was directly
beneath them when, with a sudden
rush he shot upward. It was as if a spring-board
were beneath him, for, as he hit the
surface he rose clear of the water.</p>
<p>A blue-black streak of silver, he appeared
to hang in air, then, like a depth-bomb shot
downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-what a whopper,&rdquo; Katie cried.</p>
<p>As for Florence, she was too busy saving
her bruised knuckles even to think. One thing
stood out in her mind, she would not give up.
She must have that fish.</p>
<p>Sixty seconds later the fish once again
came to the surface, this time forty feet away.
He came to the top, head, tail and all. For a
split second they were permitted to admire
him, then he was down again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Had Florence been a man, with the strong
hard grip of a man in her fingers, the battle
must have ended much sooner. As it was, time
passed swiftly and as swiftly the big fish battled
for freedom.</p>
<p>At last, just as the girl was giving up hope,
the fish, with the perversity of his kind, came
up beneath the boat, circled twice on a short
line, then lay quite still on the surface. It was
Katie who put the finishing touch to that bit
of drama. Reaching out with her strong arms
she gathered the fish, all wet and dripping, to
her bosom and &ldquo;loved him&rdquo; into the boat.
After that for a full minute the two girls sat
staring first at each other, then at the fish.
He was a forty-pounder, thirty-five at the
least; twice as large as any fish caught that
season.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Then, with the suddenness of a blow on the
head, both girls awoke to the startling fact
that during the battle their little world had
vanished. Gone was the spot of green among
the blue that is Passage Island, gone Blake&rsquo;s
Point and Edward&rsquo;s Island. There was no
land, only black threatening skies and blacker
water. Clouds and fog had blotted out everything.
Stealing up from behind Isle Royale,
one of Superior&rsquo;s sudden storms was racing
down upon them. Katie courageously gripped
her oars. But which way? Who could tell?
In vain their eyes scoured the surface of the
waters for the Lone Fisherman. He was not
to be seen. Man or phantom, he had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand fish,&rdquo; said Katie, striving in
vain to keep the tremble out of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence thought, &ldquo;it is a wonderful
fish, but at what cost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a sober pair that faced the immediate
future. Low-lying clouds had blotted out every
trace of land. They were a mile from anywhere.
Which way was land? How were they
to know? Two hours before the wind had
been off-shore. If they now headed into the
wind, would they reach the island? Lake
Superior winds change on a moment&rsquo;s notice.
If land did lie off there to windward, could
they reach it? Every moment saw the gale increasing.
White-caps were appearing.</p>
<p>Resolutely Katie headed into the wind and
began rowing. There was, on the sturdy
girl&rsquo;s face at that moment, a look of such
dogged determination as Florence had never
seen there before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I got her into this,&rdquo; she thought soberly.
&ldquo;It was wrong to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, had it been wrong? It was their
day off. They had wanted a good time. They
had had it, too. No one could deny that. Yet
they had been&mdash;well, perhaps one might say
rash, impulsive. Did impulse ever have any
rightful place in one&rsquo;s life? She wondered and
could not answer. Surely life would be dull if
everyone plodded straight on always doing
the sure, safe thing. No vim nor sparkle to
life. And yet&mdash;</p>
<p>Suddenly she realized that this was not a
time for thought but for action. Extra oars
lay in the bottom of the boat. Seizing these
she set them in place, then waited until she
had caught the rhythmic swing of Katie&rsquo;s
rowing. After that for a full quarter hour the
creak of oars, the whistle of wind and the low
swish of mounting waves were all that disturbed
the silence of those black waters.</p>
<p>Suddenly Florence felt a hand on her shoulder.
&ldquo;Stop rowing,&rdquo; said Katie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Katie made no reply. Instead she turned
the boat about to guide it by slow, easy strokes
straight away from the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo; Her voice sounded tired
when at last she spoke. &ldquo;All the time the
wind it grows stronger. Perhaps land is this
way. Who knows? We cannot go against
the wind. With the wind we can go far, far!
It is a good boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a note almost of affection in the
big girl&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;It is a Thompson boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence did not know what a Thompson
boat was. She did know that their boat was
deep, straight across the top and strong. She
was thankful for all this. But which way were
they heading? In some directions it was two
hundred miles to land. And who could tell
how this storm would end?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waves, mountain high,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Lake Superior at its worst.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />A FLASH IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>An hour later darkness lay like a black
blanket over the waters of Superior. Every
moment of that hour saw the gale increase
and the waves mount higher, yet the strong
arms of Katie never wavered. Heading
straight away from the storm, she held their
boat to a course.</p>
<p>Florence was obliged to admit that for once
her steady nerves that had stood so much had
now all but deserted her. What was the end
to be? Would they drift on and on in the
path of the storm until waves were strong
enough to swamp their boat? As she listened
she caught the low hiss of each wave and
shuddered in spite of her courage.</p>
<p>Then, with a suddenness that was startling,
a light that was fairly blinding flashed over
their heads. Florence was thrown into consternation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ka-Katie!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What is it? Are
we in the path of a steamer?&rdquo; Through her
mind there flashed a vision of some black bulk
looming out of the night.</p>
<p>As for Katie, so overcome by emotion was
she that for a space of seconds she could not
speak. When at last she found her voice, she
exclaimed joyously, &ldquo;It is the Passage Island
light. I forgot it. We are almost at the island.
Listen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they both listened there came the roar
of waters beating on rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s terrible,&rdquo; Florence said in a low,
awed tone. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t land there. Our
boat would be smashed to splinters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not there,&rdquo; Katie agreed. &ldquo;But on this
side there is an entrance. There is a snug
little harbor. If only we can find that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if only we can. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Florence&rsquo;s voice was drowned by
a hoarse hoot that filled all the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she all but jumped out of the boat.
Then she laughed. &ldquo;The Passage fog horn!
I have heard it at a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Katie agreed, &ldquo;the light and the
horn. They should have been there before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps something was wrong with their
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, for some time neither girl spoke.
Katie was busy with the oars and Florence
with her thoughts. Long thoughts they were,
you may be sure.</p>
<p>It was a relief to know their position. And
yet, how much danger lurked before them?
Ships going north pass between Isle Royale
and Passage Island. Should they find themselves
in the path of a freighter the black waters
of the night might swallow up their
smashed boat. Their fate would never be
known. They were headed for Passage Island.
But could they find the entrance to that harbor?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katie,&rdquo; Florence said, &ldquo;how wide is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is what?&rdquo; Katie demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entrance to that harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty feet, I think,&rdquo; Katie replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty feet!&rdquo; Florence thought this but
did not say it. Could they find such an entrance
in the dark and could they, with waves
mounting high, make that entrance? It
seemed to her all but impossible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>A sudden feeling of rebellion swept over
her. Here she was taking a day off, trying to
have a good time. For weeks she had worked
hard with little or no hope of reward. She
had worked for the good of others. And
now&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Not fair at
all.&rdquo; Her fists clenched tight, she looked out
over the black waters where white crests of
foam played.</p>
<p>One moment more and she was in a different
mood. What was it, after all, that she had
asked of life? Thrills, adventure, suspense,
mystery, that was it. Happy adventure. Well,
she had known all these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; she told herself stoutly, &ldquo;shall
be just one more happy adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now Katie was straining eyes and ears.
&ldquo;We are close, perhaps too close,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Sometimes the waves, they bring
you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She veered to the right. Dashes of spray
cut sharply at their cheeks. &ldquo;We must take
it,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;or we may crash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence &ldquo;took it&rdquo; in silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>The whole setting was strange beyond belief.
With that bright light flashing above
them they were in darkness. Not one trace
could they see of the cliffs against which the
waters dashed madly.</p>
<p>Then, for the first time, as if to light their
way, there came a gleam from the clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lightning!&rdquo; said Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rocks! Close&mdash;too close!&rdquo; exclaimed
Katie. They were both right.</p>
<p>The moments that followed will remain long
in Florence&rsquo;s memory. No more flashes came.
The roar of surf on rocks was deafening. They
were close. But how close? Were there low,
jutting rocks ahead? Would there come a
grinding crash and after that the end? Somewhere
in that wall was a gap. Where? How
were they to find it?</p>
<p>It seemed the darkness and suspense would
become unbearable. Then came again that
flash across the sky. Three flashes, close together.
These served only to mock them. The
first flash gave them hope. The rocky wall
was still there. Perhaps the gap was only a
little way ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Now came a second flash. What was this?
The wall was low now. It seemed that here
were only jagged rocks. The girl&rsquo;s heart sank.</p>
<p>One more moment passed into eternity, then
another flash and she knew. About them was
only black water flecked with foam. They had
drifted past the mile-long island without finding
the gap. They could not go back. They
must go on. Where to?</p>
<p>Florence buried her face in her hands and
tried to think, but her thoughts, like the sky
and sea, were one mad whirl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />A WEIRD RESTING PLACE</h2>
<p>Rain came sweeping down upon the sea.
This flattened out the waves but added
greatly to their misery. The wind raced on.
Riding with it they moved forward into the
great dark unknown.</p>
<p>Just when Florence was ready to give up
hope her keen ears caught again the sound
of waves rushing over rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more shore!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Is there
another island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other island,&rdquo; Katie&rsquo;s voice was solemn,
&ldquo;only rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence thought as a fresh chill ran
up her spine, &ldquo;there are rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>She remembered it now. She had seen them
rising above the water. One was called Gull
Rock. Sportsmen went there to fish. Were
they approaching Gull Rock? And if they
were? She found little comfort in such
thoughts. The waves were still running high.</p>
<p>Forcing her mind away from the immediate
terror, she thought of Dave and Jeanne, of
Mike and Tony and the mysterious boy in
the crimson sweater hiding away in the forests.
Did he truly set the fires? If he did what
was his motive? No one had seen him even
close enough to know how he looked. Would
Mike and Tony catch him? Would&mdash;</p>
<p>Of a sudden a dull, grating tremor passed
through the staunch little boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-what happened,&rdquo; she gasped. They
had reached the crest of a wave. Now their
boat was gliding backward. The darkness was
intense. Peer as she might, she could see
nothing save the dim outline of Katie&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the rock,&rdquo; Katie&rsquo;s voice was deathly
calm. &ldquo;That wave was not high. The next will
be higher. We will be carried onto the rocks.
We must jump. It is our chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not say, &ldquo;Our only chance.&rdquo; Florence
knew it all the same. At that moment
she was thankful for slacks and sneaks. They
would improve her chance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Katie!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;The rock! Is it high?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? We must jump. Now&mdash;&rdquo;
Katie caught a long breath. &ldquo;Now we are
going up. Now&mdash;&rdquo; There came a shuddering
grind much more terrible than the first.
&ldquo;Now jump! And run&mdash;run away from the
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping the gunwale, Florence vaulted
over the side, struck a slippery rock, all but
fell, then, regaining her footing dashed with
the energy of despair up the slanting rock.</p>
<p>Had not the stout Katie gripped her arm
just in time, she must have dashed quite across
the rock and have fallen down the steep side
into the boiling water below.</p>
<p>As for Katie, there was no chance of over-valuing
her wisdom at such a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she cried, once her companion had
regained a little of her composure, &ldquo;That great
wave left our boat on the rock. There will be
three small ones, then perhaps a greater one.
We must save our boat if we can. You on one
side, I on the other, we must slide it higher.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Left to herself, Florence would not have
taken one step toward those racing waters,
but inspired by her companion&rsquo;s splendid
courage, she retraced her steps, seized the
boat and, with energy born of despair, did her
full share of lifting the boat to a higher position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Katie panted. &ldquo;Now! Now! And
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she heaved away Florence counted the
waves. &ldquo;One, two, three.&rdquo; Would the fourth
be larger?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; she cried, as its dark, shadowy
bulk appeared to rise above her. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&mdash;is
a terrible one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; Katie cried once again.</p>
<p>Florence needed no urging. This time, however,
she measured her distance with great
care.</p>
<p>With anxious eyes they stared into the darkness.
Had they done enough? Had their
precious boat been saved, or would it go floating
away, never to be seen again? Florence
had visions of herself perched on a barren
rock through a night of cold and darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray! We win!&rdquo; Katie exclaimed. &ldquo;The
boat is still there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>It was true. The wave had reached out,
but not far enough. They were in possession
of a shelter from the storm and a means of
leaving when the storm had passed. Florence
breathed a deep sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Katie, &ldquo;we must lift it higher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed, as, starting forward,
she stumbled over some solid object and
fell flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;are you hurt?&rdquo; Katie bent over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&mdash;I fell over something, Katie! It&rsquo;s
a driftwood log! We can use it for a roller.
That makes it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it did, in more ways than one. Having
rolled the boat forward on the log, they fumbled
in the prow of the boat for a fire-fighter&rsquo;s
hatchet they knew was there. They hacked at
the log until there were dry chips aplenty.</p>
<p>Then Katie said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tip over the boat.
We&rsquo;ll use part of the log to prop it up. This
makes a house.&rdquo; There was a note of pure
joy in her voice. &ldquo;I have matches in the pocket
of my boot. They are always there. We shall
have such a fine fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Such a fine fire as it was, too. To Florence,
whose teeth would not cease chattering, it
seemed the jolliest fire in the world.</p>
<p>The north shore of Isle Royale is strewn
with smooth, eight-foot pulpwood logs that
have escaped from booms in Canada and, drifting
across, have lodged on those shores. From
the crevices of their rock Katie and Florence
managed to gather nine of these dry logs.
Soon four were blazing brightly.</p>
<p>Hidden from the wind by their over-turned
boat, warmed by the fire, the girls managed
to struggle from their soaked outer garments
and prop them on sticks before the fire.</p>
<p>For a full hour they lay there before the
blazing logs. Soaking in the cheering heat
and dreaming, half asleep, they all but forgot
that this spot was far from their snug floating
home, the <i>Wanderer</i>, and Isle Royale with all
its problems.</p>
<p>When Florence at last sat up to stretch herself
and stir up the fire, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Katie,
I&rsquo;m hungry. Seems to me I remember something
about a meal we were to eat on the rocks
after the fishing was done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not these rocks.&rdquo; Katie laughed a deep,
happy laugh. &ldquo;But these will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had planned a supper of planked fish
on the rocks off Edward&rsquo;s Island. Snugly
stowed away in the prow of the boat was a
closed tin bucket containing sandwiches, a
small pie and salt for the fish.</p>
<p>With some difficulty, Katie managed to
prepare a plank from a flat section of log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big one?&rdquo; Florence asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Never!&rdquo; Katie was horrified. &ldquo;That
prize! No. We shall go home tomorrow and
we shall say, &lsquo;See, we have been fishing and
we caught this one. Such a whopper!&rsquo;&rdquo; Once
again she laughed her deep, mellow laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;one of the little ones will
do very well. A two-pound fish. Who could
ask for more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fish was cleaned, boned and laid out
flat on the plank. Then, with a wire, Katie
bound it fast. For a full half hour after that
the fish hung stewing and sizzling over the
fire. Turning browner and browner, it was at
last like the rich gold of an autumn leaf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Katie with a sigh, &ldquo;it is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her short life Florence had eaten many
grand meals and in many a curious place. But
none was as grand as this and no place more
strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she sighed when it was over, &ldquo;we
must sleep, for tomorrow will be another day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sleep they did. Rolled up in their dried out
garments, crowded close together before the
great, glowing bed of coals, they slept the
sleep of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Twice during the night Florence was conscious
of Katie&rsquo;s movements as she replenished
the fire, and that was all.</p>

<br />SECOND WARNING</h2>
<p>In the meantime, driven from her sun bath
by that same storm, Jeanne had begun
worrying about the safety of her friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be getting pretty wild out there,&rdquo;
Dave said, as he tried to see through the driving
fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they would go far?&rdquo; Jeanne
asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Florence,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d
take a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to a fishing guide on the dock he
said, &ldquo;Where are the best spots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For lake trout fishing? Blake&rsquo;s Point and
Five Foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And neither is protected from storms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say not,&rdquo; the man laughed hoarsely.
&ldquo;Blake&rsquo;s Point reaches out into Lake Superior
like a pointing finger. Five Foot is a clean
mile from anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would it do any good to go out and look
for them?&rdquo; Dave asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this fog?&rdquo; the man laughed again. &ldquo;Not
a bit. Never find them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re probably O.K.,&rdquo; he consoled.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a sturdy pair. They&rsquo;d make a point
on one of the small islands. Plenty of driftwood
everywhere. With a good fire and moss
for a bed they&rsquo;ll get on very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are narrow channels between
the small islands,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;Storms don&rsquo;t
hit there. They may come sneaking in along
the shore any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loaded with supplies, the <i>Iroquois</i> arrived
alongside the <i>Wanderer</i> at dusk. Captain Frey
was on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of these supplies,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;go to
Florence Bay. That&rsquo;s about twenty-five miles
up the north shore. The <i>Iroquois</i> can&rsquo;t get in
there. We have a hundred fire-fighters there.
They&rsquo;ve been living on salt pork and beans for
two days. How about going there tonight?&rdquo;
he asked Dave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we can do it,&rdquo; was Dave&rsquo;s prompt
response. He was thinking of Florence and
Katie. But his first duty was to those hungry
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If those girls don&rsquo;t show up by dawn,&rdquo; he
said to the guide, &ldquo;get out your boat and look
them up. I&rsquo;ll stand the expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; was the prompt response, &ldquo;you can
depend on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Dave replied heartily.</p>
<p>An hour later, well loaded with supplies,
the <i>Wanderer</i> stole out into the night. From
time to time as they moved slowly down the
channel between small islands and at last
around Blake&rsquo;s point, they gave long blasts
on their siren. The only response was the
scream of a seagull or the wail of the wind.</p>
<p>The pitching of the boat made rest impossible,
so, encased in sweaters, blankets and a
huge oilskin coat, Jeanne sat huddled on deck,
feeling the cold damp of spray on her cheeks,
and wondering about the fate of her two
good pals.</p>
<p>Shortly after midnight, guided by the light
of a forest fire, they slipped into a narrow bay,
there to be given an uproarious welcome by
a hundred hungry men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait the night out here,&rdquo; was Dave&rsquo;s
decision. &ldquo;There are supplies for McCargoe&rsquo;s
Cove on board. We&rsquo;ll drop them off on the
way back. And you&mdash;&rdquo; there was an extra
note of friendliness in his voice as he spoke
to the little French girl, &ldquo;you better get some
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s beauty-rest that night was a short
one. However, her hours of dreaming in the
sun the previous day stood her in good stead
and she was up with the sun. Early as it was
she found the <i>Wanderer</i> in motion.</p>
<p>After serving the crew with coffee and hot
cakes, she came on deck to watch the shore
line slipping by.</p>
<p>It was still early when the boat began sliding
into McCargoe&rsquo;s Cove. At the entrance
of this cove was one of the most entrancing
little islands Jeanne had ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Please drop
me off in the dory and let me visit that island
until you come back this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Be glad to.&rdquo; Dave signaled for a
stop. &ldquo;They call it Birch Island. It&rsquo;s a beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>As she came close to the island in her small
boat, Jeanne assured herself that here was a
place of great enchantment.</p>
<p>White birches, evenly spaced and reaching
for the sky, grew to the very water&rsquo;s edge.
Mingled with these were hundreds of fern-like
balsams.</p>
<p>A single fisherman&rsquo;s cottage, built of weather
beaten logs, stood close to the shore. Silent
and seemingly deserted, it told of another day.</p>
<p>That this cabin had not been long deserted,
Jeanne was not slow in discovering. True,
save for a few rusty cans of pepper, ginger
and other spices, there was no food on the
narrow shelves. But the frying pan, tea-kettle
and coffee pot still shone brightly.</p>
<p>Leaving the cabin, the little French girl
wandered down a narrow path that ran the
length of the island. It was not a long walk.
She was soon at the far end of the island.
There, to her surprise, she discovered a second
cabin. Perhaps one might say it was only
a shelter. Built of driftwood logs, it had but
three sides and a roof. The front was enclosed
only by a mosquito-bar canopy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>When Jeanne had looked within she backed
hurriedly away. She was, she thought, intruding
on someone&rsquo;s privacy. A few pots and
pans hung against one wall, while on the opposite
side, in considerable disarray, were garments,
quite evidently a man&rsquo;s. From the nature
and color of these clothes she concluded
the man must be from some city and quite a
young man.</p>
<p>She was not long lacking in proof of this
theory. Even as she stood there, the low thud
of footsteps reached her. With a voiceless cry
and a soundless leap, she was away in the
bush.</p>
<p>She had escaped. Yet curiosity compelled
her to linger for a peeping look through the
bushes.</p>
<p>What she saw startled her no end. A tall,
good-looking youth of uncertain age stood before
the shelter. His gaze wandered from
place to place. &ldquo;He suspects something,&rdquo; the
girl told herself as her heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>And then she barely avoided a gasp. She
had, for the first time, noted his manner of
dress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A crimson sweater!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;The&mdash;the
youth in the crimson sweater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she found any reason for questioning
her judgment in this case it would not have
been for long. Of a sudden, the youth glanced
down at his feet then, without a backward
look, dashed away into the bush.</p>
<p>Surprised and startled, Jeanne held her
ground. For all this, her heart was beating a
pretty tattoo against her ribs. Where had this
boy gone? Would he return? And if he did
what should she do? Her first thought was to
slip swiftly and silently away. And yet&mdash;she
recalled her first warning, dropped from the
airplane. He had not heeded the warning, at
least had not come out into the open and
proved himself innocent. Would a second
warning help? She dared hope it might.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>With fingers that trembled in spite of her
best efforts to control them, she drew a stub
of a pencil from her jacket pocket, pulled a
square of birch bark from a tree to serve as
paper, then wrote in scrawled words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Second warning</i>: You are suspected of
a terrible crime. If you are innocent you
will come out and clear yourself. Gypsies
never forget.</p>
<p><span class="center">Signed,</span>
<span class="jr">Gypsy Jeanne.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why had Jeanne signed this second warning?
Perhaps she could not have told. Was
it because the youth in the crimson sweater
seemed a rather romantic figure?</p>
<p>With knees that all but refused to support
her, she moved slowly toward the shelter.
Once there, she slipped inside, placed the note
on a small, hand-made table, weighted it down
with a stone, then, springing away like a
startled deer, went racing toward the fisherman&rsquo;s
cabin and her boat.</p>
<p>Arrived at the small dock she found all
serene as before. Some small bird whistled at
her from a tree. A pine squirrel chattered at
her. For a moment she stood there thinking.
Why had the young man run away? He had
seen something. What had it been? In a
twinkle she had the answer, her handkerchief
was gone. &ldquo;Must have lost it and my
initials were in the corner,&rdquo; she thought, a
little startled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>After that, shoving off in her boat, she rowed
to the opposite shores, hid in a narrow cove
and waited until Dave&rsquo;s return, then climbed
aboard and rode away without a word concerning
her adventure.</p>
<p class="tb">Dawn came on the barren rock that had
saved Florence and Katie from the storm.
They were awakened by wild screams. These
were uttered by a host of angry gulls demanding
to know who had invaded their favorite
roosting place during the night.</p>
<p>Breakfast of fish and gull&rsquo;s eggs, a few
bright hours of watching the waves lose their
threat, then once more they were on the water.</p>
<p>Two hours of hard, double rowing against
the wind, a line out for trout and two catches&mdash;one
a beauty&mdash;then they were entering the
Passage Island harbor they had missed before.</p>
<p>Exclaimed over and welcomed by the lighthouse
keeper&rsquo;s smiling wife, they were fed on
roast beef and baked potatoes and brown
gravy, plied with questions, and at last taken
aboard a neat little motor craft that carried
them back to Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor and their astonished
friend who had all but given them up as
lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; exclaimed Katie, true to her promise.
&ldquo;We have been fishing. And just look what
we caught. A whopper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A whopper indeed it was&mdash;thirty-seven
pounds by the scales&mdash;easily the best fish of
the season. Was Florence proud? No end of
it. There was, however, little time for strutting.
A few moments of triumph and her insistent
mind was demanding, &ldquo;What of the
future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the <i>Wanderer</i>?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere on the north shore,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;Make yourself comfortable. They
should be back before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In two big chairs before a driftwood fire the
girls dozed the hours away. And so ended
one more happy adventure that might not
have been so happy after all, had it not been
for Lady Luck&rsquo;s kindness and Katie&rsquo;s good,
strong arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />STRANGE COMRADES IN BATTLE</h2>
<p>When Florence learned of Jeanne&rsquo;s exciting
discovery on Birch Island she
was for going there at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw him!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The boy
in the crimson sweater? The firebug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne replied quietly. &ldquo;The boy in
the crimson sweater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he like? Does he look dangerous?
What if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence shot a dozen more questions at
Jeanne. Strangely enough, the little French
girl was quite vague in her answers, much
more so than the occasion warranted. And,
when the question of her accompanying Florence
arose, she pleaded a headache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a two hour&rsquo;s run in a small motor
boat,&rdquo; Florence said to Dave. &ldquo;You have another
wait of several hours?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then suppose I hire the lodge fishing boat
and get Indian John to run me over here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K. by me. You might take Katie with
you. But watch your step! If this fellow is
really a firebug, he may be dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch,&rdquo; Florence was off.</p>
<p>Arrived at Birch Island, they found the fisherman&rsquo;s
cottage just as Jeanne had left it. But
when, after a silent march down the island,
they came to the spot where the log shelter
had stood, they discovered that it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every trace of it,&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.</p>
<p>No, this was not quite true. Dry moss had
been strewn over the spot upon which it had
stood. When this was dragged away, they
found a smooth, hard surface which once had
been an earthen floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne was not dreaming.&rdquo; Florence
looked about her as if expecting the mysterious
boy to appear. &ldquo;There has been a shelter
here. But now it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy to move,&rdquo; said Indian John. &ldquo;Take
&rsquo;em down logs. Put &rsquo;em in boat. Row away,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or just throw the logs into the lake
and let them float away,&rdquo; said Katie.</p>
<p>For some time they stood there in silence.
At last Florence said, &ldquo;I am not Jeanne and
not a gypsy, but she says there is always a
third warning and so there shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imitating Jeanne, she wrote her warning on
birch bark. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Gypsy&rsquo;s third warning. And the
last. A last chance to clear yourself.
Once we leave Birch Island, we shall set
a company of fire-fighters on your trail.</p>
<p><span class="center">Signed,</span>
<span class="jr">The Gypsy&rsquo;s Friend.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After pinning this note to a tree with the
aid of three long thorns, she was prepared to
follow her companions back to the fisherman&rsquo;s
cabin.</p>
<p>It was a silent and mystified Florence who
walked slowly back. All that had happened
appeared to prove that she was right. This
boy wished to hide. Why, unless he were doing
wrong? And what was more probable
than that he was setting fires? And yet&mdash; Why
had Jeanne been so silent, so reluctant
to tell all?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>As they at last stood again on the small
fisherman&rsquo;s dock, Florence looked at Indian
John&rsquo;s jet black hair and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are rapidly growing
gray. There are white ashes in your hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. Fine white specks of ash were
slowly drifting down from the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The threat is still with us,&rdquo; the girl murmured.</p>
<p>Nor, on this day, was it long in making itself
known. A brisk wind, blowing off the
island, began bringing in an uncomfortable
feeling of heat. Then, quite suddenly, like battling
troops coming out of the trenches, a long
line of flames appeared at the crest of a low
ridge not a mile from Birch Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; Katie exclaimed. &ldquo;It is terrible.
This beautiful island will burn unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo; Florence asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless we can save it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many birch trees, not so many
balsams. Balsam needles will catch from
sparks. Birch leaves will not. If we cut away
the balsams and throw them into the water&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must try,&rdquo; Florence broke in. &ldquo;All
this,&rdquo; her gaze swept the small island, &ldquo;must
not be destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, turning to the Indian, &ldquo;run
the boat to a safe spot and anchor it. Come
back in the skiff. We must all do our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she thought grimly a moment
later, &ldquo;that boy in the crimson sweater will be
smoked out like an owl in a hollow tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very little she knew about the truth of her
prophesy. Not knowing, she dragged a dull
ax from the fisherman&rsquo;s cabin and began doing
her bit to save Birch Island.</p>
<p>It was a battle indeed. As the wind increased
and the fire crept closer not ashes
alone, but tiny, glowing sparks fell at their
feet.</p>
<p>Whacking away at the trunks of small
spruce trees, dragging them to the water&rsquo;s
edge, then whacking and dragging again,
Florence never faltered. Grim, grimy, and
perspiring, hating her dull ax, she toiled doggedly
on. One thought was uppermost in her
mind, this battle, perhaps their last, must be
won.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>And then she received a sudden shock. A
boy stood beside her. Taller than she, he
smiled down at her. He was dressed in high
boots and corduroys. His blue, plaid shirt was
open at the neck. In his hand he carried an
ax with a razor-like edge. She had never seen
him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on in,&rdquo; she invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, may I ask?&rdquo; He
smiled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are saving this island,&rdquo; she fairly
snapped. &ldquo;If&mdash;if we get all the balsams out
it won&rsquo;t burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! That&mdash;that&rsquo;s an idea!&rdquo; His face
brightened like a sky after a storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut. You drag &rsquo;em off,&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p>After that for a full hour it was cut and
drag, cut and drag, a seemingly endless task.
And the fire grew hotter every moment.</p>
<p>Not even the girl&rsquo;s strenuous endeavors
could keep her from wondering about that
boy. Who was he? Where had he come from?
Why was he here?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He works like one who is defending his
own home,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>Strangely enough there was something
vaguely familiar about his movements. &ldquo;As
if I had seen him before. But I can&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a strange and mystifying thing happened,
as the boy bent over to pick up his ax
which had slipped from his aching fingers, a
small square of white fluttered from his pocket
to the ground. He was quick in retrieving it
but not quick enough. In one corner of this
girl&rsquo;s handkerchief Florence had read the initials,
&ldquo;J. E.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne&rsquo;s handkerchief,&rdquo; she whispered to
herself with sudden shock. &ldquo;Where did he get
it and why does he keep it?&rdquo; Strangely
enough, at that moment, all unbidden, three
words came into her mind, &ldquo;The Gypsy&rsquo;s
warning.&rdquo; Then the stern business of the moment
claimed her entire attention.</p>
<p>The last, slim end of the island was closest
to the fire. The heat became all but unbearable.
Twice the boy&rsquo;s cotton shirt began to
smoke. At last he drew it off, and dipped it in
water, to put it on again.</p>
<p>Then came the moment when the last balsam
tree toppled into the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he grabbed Florence&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;We gotta get out o&rsquo; here quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did get out quick.</p>
<p>When at last Florence reached her skiff
where Katie and Indian John were anxiously
waiting, to her astonishment she saw the
strange boy go racing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did he hear? It seemed he must. But he
raced straight on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just row out a little where the heat
is not so bad,&rdquo; Florence suggested. &ldquo;Then
we&rsquo;ll wait and see what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This they did. The moment when the raging
furnace reached the water&rsquo;s edge, then
came to a sudden halt, was a glorious one
indeed.</p>
<p>Florence was watching with all her eyes
when, of a sudden, she seemed to hear oarlocks
creaking. At first, looking out over the smoke-clouded
water she saw nothing. Then she
caught the shadowy outline of a small boat
moving out on the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be that boy,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;But
where is he going?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>The answer came to her at once. Beyond
him was the outline of a small power boat.
He was rowing toward that.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, just as he reached the
motor boat&rsquo;s side, a current of air lifted the
smoke and everything stood out clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> that boy,&rdquo; Florence said aloud. &ldquo;But
what&rsquo;s he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Standing up in his row-boat,&rdquo; said Katie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putting on a sweater. A crimson sweater!&rdquo;
Florence was ready to fall from the boat in
her excitement. &ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s that boy, the boy in
the crimson sweater. And how he has fought
this fire!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that motor boat!&rdquo; she exploded again.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one Jeannie says carries the Phantom
Fisherman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as if a curtain had been dropped, the
smoke fell hiding the boy in the crimson
sweater, the Phantom and all. Was Florence
sorry? She could not tell.</p>
<p>She did not know it at that moment, but
this was the last time she was to see either
the Phantom or the boy in the crimson sweater
on Isle Royale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end,&rdquo; Florence thought, as they
went chugging back toward Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor.
&ldquo;The wind is really shifting. It will drive the
fire back upon itself.&rdquo; Even as she thought
this, cold drops of rain struck her cheek. Rolling
up from across the lake a real rainstorm,
the first in weeks, was on its way.</p>
<p>Two hours later, drenched to the skin but
joyously happy, the little party arrived at
Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor.</p>
<p>Late that night, the great log cabin used
as a lounge for the lodge was comfortably
crowded with people. The little fisherman&rsquo;s
wife was there. One child was asleep in her
lap, another played at her side. On her face
was a look of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she was saying to the old man
near her, &ldquo;how it rains!&rdquo; Great sheets of
rain were beating against the window panes.
&ldquo;A northeast wind,&rdquo; she added in a whisper,
&ldquo;the fires are over. Our homes and our islands
are safe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>This was the joyous feeling in every heart.
That was why they were there. Drawn together
by an invisible bond of common interest
and friendship in hope and in despair, they
had gathered to celebrate.</p>
<p>In the corner, an impromptu trio&mdash;piano,
cello and violin&mdash;began playing, <i>Over the
Waves</i>.</p>
<p>As the music rose and fell, as the sparks
from the driftwood fire leaped toward the sky,
Florence thought that no moment in her
whole life had been as joyous as this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you must dance.
Dance to the patter of rain on the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jeanne agreed almost eagerly, &ldquo;I
shall dance. I have been practicing a new
dance quite in secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new dance,&rdquo; exclaimed one of the musicians,
&ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dance of the Flames</i>,&rdquo; said Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! We have the very thing, an Indian
dance to the fire god&mdash;you shall dance to our
music.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>A few moments later, after the lights had
been dimmed, when the flames from great
logs in the broad fireplace leaped high and
the strains of a weird Indian dance rose from
the corner, a slender figure clad in garments
of orange and red, with two long scarfs
streaming behind, came dancing into the room.</p>
<p>It would be hard to describe the dance that
followed. Only the little French girl could
have so caught the movement and seeming
spirit of flames. Now she was a low fire creeping
stealthily upon some stately spruce tree.
And now, urged on by some mischievous wind,
she went rushing forward. And now, by a
trick performed with the scarfs, she appeared
to rise straight in air as the flames rushed to
the very top of the tree.</p>
<p>When at last, quite exhausted, she flung herself
down at Florence&rsquo;s side, there came a
burst of applause that would have done credit
to a much larger gathering.</p>
<p>Katie arrived with a great pot of delicious
hot chocolate and a pan of cakes. They ate
and drank and then, led by a very pious old
cottager, sang a hymn of thanks to the God
who, with their aid had saved their island for
them and for their children, years on end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; Florence whispered, as they
groped their way back to the boat, &ldquo;it is for
such times as these that we live.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; the little French girl agreed, &ldquo;for
such times as these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Florence caught the sound of a
voice that caused her to start. &ldquo;Ya dese fires
dey will be over now. Dis is de end we is been
waiting for so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Florence did a strange thing. Rushing
up to the aged fisherman who had spoken
she said, &ldquo;You are the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya, I is de man,&rdquo; the fisherman agreed,
&ldquo;but what man, this is de question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice I heard you say the fires were being
set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya, it may be so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you say that? Was it true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps ya. Perhaps no,&rdquo; was the strange
answer, &ldquo;dese is been hard times. Might be
we old men think too many t&rsquo;ings.&rdquo; At that
the old man disappeared as silently as usual
into the night, leaving the girl with her own
thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />DON&rsquo;T STAY TOO LONG</h2>
<p>All that night it rained, a slow, steady
downpour. The wind that for weeks
had been driving the fire forward shifted. It
was now driving the fire back against itself.
Everyone agreed that the battle was won.
There was great rejoicing on the island. The
whole country received the glad report by
newspaper and radio.</p>
<p>Tim O&rsquo;Hara, in his New York radio tower,
at once got off a wire to Florence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations. Stop. Have set your
appearance on our program for next Tuesday.
Stop. Ticket will await you at
Houghton.</p>
<p><span class="center">Signed,</span>
<span class="jr">Tim O&rsquo;Hara.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He wants me to come to New York,&rdquo;
Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;New York,&rdquo; she repeated
softly. &ldquo;He wants me to tell the story
of our fight to save the island, tell it on his
Adventurer&rsquo;s Club radio program. Just think!
Coast to coast! Millions of people will hear.
Shall I go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go?&rdquo; Dave roared. &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll go.
Finest publicity in the world for our island.
And think of the time you&rsquo;ll have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall go with you,&rdquo; said Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Why not?&rdquo; Florence threw her
arms about her. &ldquo;No great occasion would be
complete without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two pals did little else save eat and
sleep on their way to New York. From time
to time they discussed the mysterious boy in
the crimson sweater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a nice looking boy,&rdquo; Jeanne mused.
&ldquo;Not a bit like a firebug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Florence agreed. &ldquo;Not a bit. I can&rsquo;t
think he was one. All the same I would like
to know why he always ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there a firebug at all?&rdquo; Jeanne asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably no one will ever know. Many
of the mysteries of this old earth are never
solved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take a taxi from the depot.&rdquo; This had
been the order in Tim&rsquo;s letter. Florence took
him at his word. After handing a grinning
redcap a whole quarter, she stepped into one
of those luxurious New York taxis, and said,
&ldquo;Hilton Hotel, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she settled back against the cushions
and sighed, &ldquo;Boy! This is life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the hotel desk Tim O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s letter
proved an open-sesame to all that was grand
and luxurious. They were ushered to a room
with delightfully low, twin beds, delicately
shaded light, spinet desk and even a radio.</p>
<p>Florence thought of their crowded quarters
on the <i>Wanderer</i> and sighed.</p>
<p>But not for long. To the accompaniment of
soft music, breakfast was served in the great
dining room below.</p>
<p>One more taxi and they were at the radio
building. A moment later and they looked
into Tim O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s beaming eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you could come!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I am sure you have a grand story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is Jeanne.&rdquo; He gripped the little
French girl&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Any new dances?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just one.&rdquo; Jeanne smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dance of the Flame</i>,&rdquo; Florence explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds great! But then,&rdquo; Tim added, &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t dance on the radio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;s the pity,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;It is a
glorious dance. Truly fantastic and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; said Tim O&rsquo;Hara. &ldquo;You really
can&rsquo;t describe it. We shall have it somehow,
somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he was all business, &ldquo;the other
members of the cast are here. Step into my
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There three men awaited them: a bronze-faced
giant, a man of very ordinary appearance
and a slim, wiry man with sharp black
eyes. The first had been hunting lions in the
heart of Africa, the second had been driving
dog teams in the &ldquo;farthest north&rdquo; and the
third was a revenue man, who hunted down
moonshine stills in the mountains of Kentucky.
Each had known perils and adventures. Each,
in his own way, was to tell his story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is just a get-together,&rdquo; said Tim
O&rsquo;Hara when introductions had been attended
to. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to work together for three
days&mdash;and by that I mean <i>work</i>. So we should
know one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that in a very informal manner each
told of his experiences. When Florence had
heard the others she felt the least bit unimportant.
But when, with a word here and
there from Jeanne and Tim, she had got truly
warmed up to her subject which, she laughingly
explained, was rather a hot one (fighting
fires) she realized that they all were listening
with undivided interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a complete show at all without
your part,&rdquo; Tim O&rsquo;Hara murmured in her
ear when the others were gone. &ldquo;Your story
is truly thrilling. And it has humor, interest
and real heart-throbs. We&rsquo;ll play up those little
fishing cabins and the old men who have
been coming to the island for so many years.
You come back at two-thirty and we&rsquo;ll write
the script.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;Must there be
a script? Can&rsquo;t I just tell it in my own words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own words? Surely! But it must be
put on paper. Come back at two-thirty. You
shall see it all worked out in a very grand
manner.&rdquo; He bowed them from the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So this is New York?&rdquo; Florence breathed
as they once again found themselves on the
sidewalk. &ldquo;How thrilling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over one block is 5th Avenue,&rdquo; said
Jeanne. &ldquo;So very wonderful! Gift shops eight
stories high. Everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifth Avenue, here we come!&rdquo; Florence
exclaimed, seizing Jeanne by the hand.
Once they had discovered the broad avenue,
so alive and gay, they wandered on and on.
In one shop they bought a bright plaid neck-tie
for Dave, and in another still brighter
dress material for Katie. In a music shop
around the corner Jeanne purchased a small
statue of a very great dancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my studio,&rdquo; she said with a gay laugh.
&ldquo;The place of my dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes,&rdquo; Florence thought with a sigh,
&ldquo;how much of all our lives is made of dreams.
And how very cold and lonely we would be
without them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This mood passed quickly. &ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
as a clock caught her eye, &ldquo;we must
have lunch and get back to that office!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fried oysters!&rdquo; said Jeanne as they seated
themselves at a bright green table. &ldquo;Shoestring
potatoes, coffee and lemon pie. Why
not? This is New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fried oysters it was and all the rest. Then
a taxi whisked them away to Tim O&rsquo;Hara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Tim said to Florence, as he leaned
back in his chair to close his eyes, &ldquo;tell me
all about it in greater detail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New&mdash;New York?&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s
grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not New York.&rdquo; His eyes flew open. &ldquo;Tell
me about Isle Royale.&rdquo; His eyes closed again.</p>
<p>Florence did tell him. Told him in her own
dramatic manner. From time to time he interrupted
her to exclaim, &ldquo;That was a close
one&mdash;That&rsquo;s grand&mdash;Just grand&mdash;You mean
you were trapped by the fire? They flew over
you and dropped the dog? A moose went
after the dog? You heard him ki-yi? Say!
That&rsquo;s a grand story!&rdquo; At this his eyes popped
wide open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this boy in the crimson sweater,&rdquo; his
eyes closed again. &ldquo;Tell me about him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he disappeared.&rdquo; Florence hesitated.
&ldquo;I wish we could find him. He put up such
a wonderful fight for that beautiful little
island. He wasn&rsquo;t the firebug. Probably there
wasn&rsquo;t any firebug. He knows we suspected
him. I&mdash;I wish we could find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will.&rdquo; Tim&rsquo;s eyes were wide open now.
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose we really could?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised.&rdquo; Tim leaned forward
in his chair. &ldquo;We pick all sorts of people
right out of the air. As if we had a string
on &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little while back a man was telling about
his adventures buying unclaimed trunks at
auction and trying to find their owners. One
very mysterious case baffled him. He told
about it over the air and what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days later he heard from the owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to ask a million people to
send that boy in the crimson sweater to you
and to tell you his story. And they will send
him. Someone surely will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; continued Tim, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll write your
script.&rdquo; For a half hour he pecked away at
his typewriter. Then, with a sigh, he murmured,
&ldquo;A mighty fine story. That&rsquo;s all for
now. Tomorrow in Studio Six we rehearse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four hours later the two girls stepped out
on the brightly lighted streets of America&rsquo;s
greatest city. It was night. A slender, gray-haired
man, with stooping shoulders offered
them an evening paper.</p>
<p>As Florence took the paper and dropped a
nickel into his hand she could not help noting
how bright his eyes were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t New York wonderful?&rdquo; she said in a
deep voice full of emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the old man agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful
when you&rsquo;re young. But don&rsquo;t stay too
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why not?&rdquo; she was puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New York takes you by the hand and
whirls you &rsquo;round and &rsquo;round. It&rsquo;s very wild
and gay and it makes you drunk. But bye
and bye&mdash;well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;look at me. You&rsquo;d
never guess it but I was once a reporter on that
very paper you bought. It whirls you &rsquo;round
and &rsquo;round.&rdquo; His voice cracked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay
too long, child. Don&rsquo;t stay too long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A reporter!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;I knew
a reporter. He went away to New York, Peter
Kepple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; the old man sighed, &ldquo;I knew him
here. He died&mdash;let me see, two years ago.
Don&rsquo;t stay too long, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his shrill old voice rose above the
rush and roar of New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paper! Paper! Get your evening paper
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were half a block away Florence
seemed to hear him calling, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay
too long.&rdquo; How long was too long? She did
not know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />THE INVISIBLE HOST</h2>
<p>That night Florence dreamed of herself
as a gray-haired woman in a drab shawl
selling papers on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>The bright sun of next day drove all such
dark fancies from her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne!&rdquo; she exclaimed as she bounced out
of bed, &ldquo;Today we rehearse. Tomorrow we
rehearse again. And that night comes the big
show!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the hours passed, Florence found herself
losing all thought that she was simply to make
a little six-minute talk into a microphone. The
feeling grew upon her with every passing moment
that she was to be a part of a truly big
thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>And why not? Was she not preparing to
speak to a million people? Would the opportunity
ever come again? Perhaps not. And
would not her friends be listening? Crowded
about their radios on Isle Royale, in Chicago,
in far-away Alaska, would they not be saying,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Florence! How natural her voice
sounds!&rdquo; Ah, yes, it was to be wonderful.</p>
<p>Nor did Tim O&rsquo;Hara allow a single member
of his cast to forget the importance of his
part. Every moment of rehearsal found them
keyed up to a high pitch.</p>
<p>There were individual rehearsals, general
rehearsals, a rehearsal for recording. And
then, on the second day, Florence caught her
breath as she was ushered into a large theater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the place?&rdquo; she asked, staring at a
&ldquo;mike&rdquo; in the center of the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will there be people here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thousand people.&rdquo; Florence was
ready to bolt out of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but my dear!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed. &ldquo;It
is just another show. Remember how I sang
in light opera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you are you and I am I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Jeanne. &ldquo;One or a
million! Tell them! I know you can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>When orchestra members began filing in
she felt better. Her part of the show might
not be so grand, but these would back her up.</p>
<p>Then a bright idea occurred to her, and in
thinking of others she forgot herself. It is
often so in life.</p>
<p>While others were rehearsing their parts
she slipped over to the orchestra leader and
said something to him in a low tone. He
looked at Jeanne and nodded.</p>
<p>She talked some more. He smiled broadly,
then began beating out imaginary notes with
his baton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be done,&rdquo; he agreed at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you it will be startling and wonderful!&rdquo;
said Florence.</p>
<p>The dress rehearsal thrilled her to the very
tips of her toes. As the notes of the orchestra
died away and she took her place before the
&ldquo;mike,&rdquo; she seemed to feel the expectant hush
of a real audience and from the far-flung
prairies and the blue waters of her own beloved
midwest a breath seemed to fan her
cheek. For the moment, forgetting her little
plot with the orchestra director, she went
through her part as in a dream. Almost she
expected a boy to step out from among those
empty seats and say, &ldquo;I am the boy in the
crimson sweater.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>After that her thoughts returned to the orchestra
leader and Jeanne. The moments
dragged, but at last the rehearsal was over.</p>
<p>And then, just as Tim O&rsquo;Hara was about
to bid them scatter until six-thirty, the place
went dark, a spotlight began playing over the
stage, the girl in red drew her hands across
the harp strings, the orchestra took up the
notes of some tantalizing oriental music and,
dressed in red with red and orange scarfs
streaming behind her, Jeanne danced out upon
the stage.</p>
<p>In the moments that followed the little
French girl was dancing upon a great flat
rock. The roar and crackle of fire was in her
ears, the flash and heat of flames in her eyes.</p>
<p>To the little group of onlookers this dance
was entrancing. When at last, all aflutter,
Jeanne danced away into the wings, even the
musicians dropped their instruments to applaud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; Tim O&rsquo;Hara exclaimed. &ldquo;You
shall repeat it tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you cannot dance on the radio,&rdquo;
Jeanne protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but when we go off
the air the audience here shall be treated to
a grand surprise. They shall see <i>The Dance
of the Flames</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was arranged. While Florence and
Jeanne slipped away to a little place around
the corner to sip hot chocolate and nibble at
sweet cakes, the moments passed quickly and
at last the opening moment of the great show
was at hand.</p>
<p>As the audience began to arrive the curtain
dropped and there they were, the performers
moving about, quite breathless with anticipation.
Slowly, one by one, the musicians arrived
and took their places.</p>
<p>From behind the curtain came the murmur
of many voices. How many? Florence could
not guess. One thing she knew, these were
but a handful compared to the invisible host
waiting out there in the vast spaces beyond
the theater&rsquo;s walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>Now someone outside the curtain was speaking,
welcoming the audience. There was
laughter and applause.</p>
<p>Then, slowly&mdash;ever so slowly&mdash;the curtain
rose. And there they were seated before a
theater packed to the very doors.</p>
<p>Florence caught her breath. She fixed her
eyes on the clock. At exactly seven fifteen the
show would go on the air. Fascinated, she
watched the long second hand sweep around
the dial. And then&mdash;</p>
<p>The girl in red drew her fingers across all
the chords in her harp. The little dark-eyed
Spaniard on a stool thrummed his guitar, the
big man with a bass viol drew his bow, the
horns, drums, the violins joined in with a
crashing crescendo. In the strange silence
that followed a voice said, &ldquo;The Adventurers&rsquo;
Club is on the air, coast to coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again Florence watched the circling
of that second hand. At exactly seven twenty-seven
she was to go on the air. Never had
that hand raced so madly. Her heart kept
time to its racing. At last here was a nod from
Tim O&rsquo;Hara.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>Her knees trembled as she marched up to
the microphone. But like a flash it came to
her, &ldquo;All my good friends are listening out
there. They are part of the invisible host.
I shall speak to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she did. The audience before her
thrilled and chilled at hearing of her adventures.
They laughed when she told how Plumdum
got his name and were breathlessly silent
as she told of being trapped by the flames, of
Plumdum&rsquo;s parachute jump, and of the mad
moose. As she told of her escape they burst
into applause. But to her, the great, invisible
audience counted most. And when, in her last
tense sixty seconds, she sent out an appeal, it
was for one person somewhere out there on
the air, the boy with the crimson sweater.</p>
<p>Ten seconds of applause followed her
speech. This was broken in upon by the wild
wail of the harp strings, and her share of the
big show was at an end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>At an end? Not quite. Truth is, she was
only half through. At ten thirty there would
be another show for the western states. And
before that, she knew, the whole cast was to
be treated to a banquet in one of the show
places of New York. What a night!</p>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s triumph, as, at the end of the performance,
she did her weird dance of the
flame, was even greater than Florence&rsquo;s own.
And Florence was glad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br />OUT OF THE AIR</h2>
<p>As Florence sat in a shadowy corner of
the stage waiting for the company to
gather and start their march to the banquet
hall, she was thinking, &ldquo;I wonder if he heard.
If he did, shall I hear from him? Or will the
mystery of the boy in the crimson sweater remain
unsolved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was roused from these wonderings by
Jeanne&rsquo;s voice in her ears, &ldquo;Come, <i>ma cherie</i>!
It is time to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Florence, who had lived so much of her
life in out-of-the-way places, their banquet
hall with its blinking candles, snow-white
linen and glistening silver was a place of great
enchantment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>They were all there: Tim O&rsquo;Hara and his
two bright-eyed young secretaries, the harpist
in her red waist, the little Spaniard who
played the guitar, the entire cast and several
others.</p>
<p>They were all scanning the bill of fare when
there was a commotion at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come in,&rdquo; a waiter was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must come in,&rdquo; a youthful voice insisted.
&ldquo;They called me in out of the air and
here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out&mdash;out of the air!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed,
springing to her feet.</p>
<p>At that instant the intruder broke from the
head waiter&rsquo;s grasp and there he stood, the
boy in the crimson sweater.</p>
<p>Tim O&rsquo;Hara sized up the situation at a
glance. Next instant he was on his feet,
&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen.&rdquo; There was a thrill
in his voice. &ldquo;I have always insisted that we
bring them in from the air. Now here is
visible proof. Less than an hour ago Miss
Huyler broadcast an appeal. It was to the boy
in the crimson sweater. And now here he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the boy he said, &ldquo;Whoever you
are and whatever your name, you are a welcome
guest at our party.&rdquo; At that he ushered
him to a place at Florence&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s story was soon told. He had been
sent to the island by the conservation editor
of a New York magazine. His task had been
to determine, as far as possible, how many
wild moose were on the island. Some seventy
or more had been taken from the island. Were
there still hundreds or thousands? All those
interested in wild life wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the fires started,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I
thought of volunteering as a fire-fighter. But
I had to have the count of moose for the next
issue of the magazine. I couldn&rsquo;t back out on
the job I&rsquo;d been sent to do. So I continued to
count moose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;well, you know
how it is. You sometimes feel things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed, &ldquo;and sometimes
feel them wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this time I felt them right.&rdquo; He
laughed. &ldquo;I was suspected of doing something
terrible. I was suspected of setting fires. How
horrible! I setting fires! I who have always
worshipped trees as God&rsquo;s first temples?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how were we to know?&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.
&ldquo;We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the boy broke in.
&ldquo;Nor could you help my being angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I decided to play the
game out to the end. So I dodged you again
and again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end came,&rdquo; he took a long breath,
&ldquo;when Birch Island was in peril. That island
had been my home. I loved it. And I loved
the &lsquo;Phantom Fisherman&rsquo; as you called him.
He was my friend and that island was his
home too. So you see,&rdquo; he laughed low, &ldquo;I
had to come out in the open and fight beside
you. I was sure you&rsquo;d never know me without
my sweater. When the fight was over I
put the sweater on where you could see me.
Then I vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo; Florence did not finish, just
sat staring at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I caught a small boat to the mainland, prepared
my report, and came to New York just
in time to find you here. Which is worth all
my trouble,&rdquo; he added with a touch of gallantry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to give myself up,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What I didn&rsquo;t know was that you&rsquo;d call for
me from the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he went on after a brief silence,
&ldquo;was the finishing touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; his tone changed, &ldquo;something
tells me this is a grand feed and I&rsquo;m keeping
you from enjoying it. Suppose we proceed.
Don&rsquo;t let me spoil your celebration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enjoy it they did to the full. When it was
over they all went trooping back to the
theater for the final performance.</p>
<p>To her surprise, Florence found herself going
through her act the second time like a
seasoned actor. As her voice went out over
the air, no one listening in would have guessed
that she was just another girl from the tall
timber of Isle Royale.</p>
<p>When Jeanne had repeated her dance of
the flames and the curtain was run down for
the last time, the two girls said goodbye to
that jolly, friendly company and to their new
friend in the red sweater. After that they
strolled out to the brightly lit streets of New
York at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the people,&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They act as if they did not mean to go home
till morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they neared their hotel they heard a
cracked voice calling, &ldquo;Extra! Extra! All
about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s our
old newsboy. I must buy one more paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she took the paper she slipped a silver
half dollar into his bony hand. He stared at
her for a moment, then coming close he said
in a low voice, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay too long, child.
Don&rsquo;t stay too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she said to Jeanne, as they
entered their room a moment later. &ldquo;Look!
It is midnight. New York has been whirling
us &rsquo;round and &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; Jeanne sighed. &ldquo;But it has been
glorious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed. &ldquo;For all that, I&rsquo;m
glad we&rsquo;re starting back to Isle Royale and
the <i>Wanderer</i> tomorrow. I want to hear the
wash of the waves on the rocky shore and the
seagull&rsquo;s scream. I want to waken in the
night and catch the hoarse hoot of the fog
horn on Passage Island. I want to smell the
cool damp of balsam and spruce trees and
watch the sun go down over Green Stone
Ridge. That&rsquo;s life for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>ma cherie</i>,&rdquo; Jeanne agreed. &ldquo;That <i>is</i>
life, but not for your little Jeanne, not for a
long, long time to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Florence was
startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A letter from France,&rdquo; Jeanne explained.
&ldquo;It has followed me days and days. Now it
has caught up with me. I must return to
France at once. So you see, my dear, it is
goodbye. I go east and you go west. Is it
not ever so?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall come back,&rdquo; her spirits rose.
&ldquo;When the tulips nod gaily and there is the
scent of lilacs in the air I shall return. And
then&mdash;<i>Oh, la&mdash;la!</i> Who knows what will happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning on the deck of Jeanne&rsquo;s ship
they clasped hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we meet again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>And so they parted. Shall they meet again?
We can but repeat Florence&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Who
knows?&rdquo; If they do and it is our good fortune
to learn of their further adventures you
shall read of them in a book to be called,
<i>Mystery in Red</i>.</p>
